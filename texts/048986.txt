Avena+ Test Bed explores the relationship between landscape, agriculture and digital fabrication. With the advent of precision farming, agriculture has become fully mapped and will transform farming to a highly digital activity. In combination with other changes underway in the countryside, mainly the paradigm shift from food to biogas production and various EU subsidy schemes to promote diversity, within the next few years this will lead to disruptive changes for the (European) countryside.The project uses the idea of “agricultural printing” to explore the possibilities of digital fabrication carried over into farming. The experiment applies algorithms to partition and to create an environmentally beneficial structure in a standard biomass/energy production field. These additional areas establish or improve the connectivity between habitats for fauna and flora. This increased diversity also eases typical problems of monocultures, e.g. fewer vermin → reduced usage of pesticides. Furthermore a farmer could “rent out” the areas for several months a year as a compensatory area in the same way as the CO2 emissions trading scheme works (in the EU all new building land has to be compensated; there is already a market for these areas). Hence in the near future a farmer might not just produce oats, peas, beans and barley, but also print “environment compensations areas” into his fields. The overall aim of the project is to look into the potential of these changes (already underway), especially in terms of design opportunities. The emphasis lies in speculating about new models that would enhance current agricultural practices, and to then imagine their possible implications.Plants: 85% oats (Avena sativa), 15% eleven different flowers and herbsDimensions: 11.5 hectares (320 m x 920 m) in Unterwaldhausen, South Germany
