'Chip Radio' was a concert that took place in three Austrian radio studios simultaneously (in Salzburg, Innsbruck and Dornbirn) and was transmitted live on O l 's Kunstradio program. The existing network of data and audio links between the three studios is used für multi-layered, real-time interaction between the musicians. The lobby of each studio is connected with the other two (architecturally identical) rooms. Three basically isolated events are linked up and made 'tele-present'. The physical distances between them are made visibly - and audibly - 'transparent' through multi-channel link-ups. Overcoming geographical separation, musicians in separate cities are gathered together in a room with no boundary but the speed of electro-magnetic waves. 'Chip Radio' confronts the distributive mass media of radio with the reality of inter-communicative networks, harnessing the potential of both networks. Mia Zabelka's control data for electronic instruments travel through the network leaving visible, graphic traces on video monitors. Gerfried Stocker uses a dataglove to reach through the network, through space, to play an acoustic instrument at the other end. Andres Bosshard's differential microphone placement passe s on spatial acoustic information from one studio to the other two.Technical BackgroundHW: MS DOS, Atari, Apple MacintoshSW: Icon, C-Base, Max, Artists’ Proprietary, Environment Processing by C.
