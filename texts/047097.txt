Since the late 1990s, Rozin’s constructions have investigated the psychological and optical cues inherent in image building, such as pattern and the materiality of the picture plane. In a departure from the traditional rectilinear grid, Rozin’s 2012-13 series of work proposes another geometric basis of image creation. His Angles series focuses on rotational systems of orientation. These works celebrate the polar or angular notations of pictographic information. The Angles Mirror rejects the idea of building a picture based on relative lightness and darkness. Instead, it explores a system of linear rotation that indicates the direction of an object’s contour. A wall-mounted sculpture, the Angles Mirror is a sharp triangular block of steel, dotted with yellow, pivoting indicator arms. Based on the isometric grid, its structure favors the patterns and angles found in an equilateral triangle. The arms, which cannot change brightness or luminosity, use input from a camera and reconstruct the view with areas of varying angles. The negative space surrounding a viewer is translated into horizontal lines on the picture plane. Rather than creating a photorealistic image, the three-dimensional movement of a figure is represented, visualizing optical flow as the viewer’s proximity to the sculpture changes. A nuanced contour results, as the viewer shifts back and forth, altering the way the structure of space is perceived. In the Angles Mirror, the sequence of movement across the picture plane is directed in part by its audience. When the viewer walks away from the work, or chooses to view the sculpture from a distance, a series of predefined images and transitions cover the object’s surface.
