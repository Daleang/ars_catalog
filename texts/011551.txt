Working together since 2000, @c started as a trio and later shrank to a duo that occasionally reexpands into an audiovisual trio when performing with the Austrian artist Lia.The musical work of @c is developed in the cross-section of three complimentary approaches to sound art and electronic music: algorithmic composition, concrete sounds and improvisation. If on the one hand their compositions are usually built around strong structural foundations, it is also common that multiple bits are freed from these structures when integrated into the sound work, contributing to the settling of elaborate strategies of deconstruction. Improvisation, either in dialogue or discussion, is central to @câ€™s performances, as is the will to create open compositions and to nurture ongoing processes that digitally amplify sound realities. The creation of cross-links between referrals and memories plays with the balance between reconnaissance and abstraction.
