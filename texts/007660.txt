The Danube Panorama Project is an experimental approach to photographic mapping and cartography. Its goal is to produce a full panorama of the Danube's riverbanks by digitally slit-scanning its coastlines, resulting in a unique cross section of contemporary Europe.The Danube—“Europe's River of Destiny”—connecting Western, Central and Eastern Europe uniquely reflects the shifting relationships of its peoples, cultures and religions in its accumulated history and contemporary dimensions. It is as much a cultural as a geographic landscape. The Danube will serve as a symbolic red line through this intense survey.Aesthetically, The Danube Panorama Project is a modern revival of a forgotten art form, the Panorama. The River Panorama (also know as Moving Panorama), was one of the first immersive “media” or virtual arts and is a sub-class of the Panorama, featuring river coastlines of the Hudson, Mississippi or Missouri River by unrolling (reportedly mile-long) canvas past the viewer. These River Panoramas were highly popular events in North America through the late 19th Century.The Slit-Scan Imaging Technology has been applied for the recording of The Danube Panorama. Slit-Scan is a traditional film and photographic technique that uses a focal plane shutter or slit as aperture. The film is exposed by moving it past a fine slit. In the digital realm this is done by image processing—one can simply cut out pixel columns of video-frames and assemble them back into static or moving images.
