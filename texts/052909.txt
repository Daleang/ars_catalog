The Processing Foundationâ€™s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.We do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes Processing, p5.js, and Processing.py, and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.The Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access. At our core is the philosophy and politics of open-source software. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process.
