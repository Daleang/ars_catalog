In spring 2006, Harvard University commissioned a work of art by Brian Knep as the culmination of his year-long artist-in-residency. He chose the Memorial Hall as a venue, and using the Civil War as a metaphor for unfinished healing, created Deep Wounds, a site-specific, interactive installation about memory, history, pain and reconciliation.Built between 1870 and 1878, the Memorial Hall honors the Harvard graduates who died in the Civil War while fighting for the Union. Surrounded by beautiful stained-glass windows and cathedral ceilings, each of these men’s names, year of graduation, date of death and date of battle are permanently inscribed on the marble walls. Deep Wounds used this space to consider unfinished healing and reconciliation. “Wounds have a lasting effect,” says Knep, “that can shape the course of history.”Hints of inscribed text are projected onto the glowing, white marble floor. As one walks across, the luminous floor, skin blisters and opens to reveal descriptions of Harvard graduates who died while fighting for the Confederacy. Each man’s year of graduation, state, date of death and date of battle are projected onto the floor. Instead of a name, however, one sees a description such as “father” or “classmate” describing a family relationship or a relationship to schoolmates on the wall. After the uncovering, the skin mends itself, covering the names once again.
