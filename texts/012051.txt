The “LED Eyelash” project was initiated from a very simple question: Why do women want bigger eyes? Asian women’s desire for bigger eyes may be understood as a kind of fetish, the fetish of big eyes, which may be explicable with the plastic surgery obsession. If someone wears it and moves her head, the LED will flicker, following the movement by sensor. It is as simple to use as wearing a false eyelashes and as easy to remove as taking off a piece of jewelry.
