Tunnel is a kinetic, immersive and interactive sculpture composed of 92 porticos that become disordered as a function of the position and body mass of the interactor. Numerous users can enter and interact with the machine simultaneously. Interactors influence the machine via their position and weight. As an example of interaction: you enter the Tunnel and stand at the center. From this perspective, the aligned porticos fuse and, in your perception, they form walls. Another example: you go into the Tunnel and stand by one of the side walls. In this case, the relative position and the gravitational force of your body provokes variations in the floor height. The floor inclines up to 5ยบ, the associated porticos progressively rotate in the corresponding direction and angle, and this spreads undulating movements throughout the entire installation. For the outside observer, the internal movement or your displacement in relation to the installation produces kinetic optic effects.
