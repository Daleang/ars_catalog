“Extended Cognitive Tools” is the general name for software that has expressions for extending human recognition and includes Incompatible BLOCK”, “OLE Coordinate System”, and “Constellation”. “Incompatible BLOCK” is a block-based 3D modeling software with an interface of wonders. While the user edits blocks by dragging them across the screen, based on 2D interpretation rather than 3D construction, the system places the block. The “OLE Coordinate System” has some interactive illusions that enable the character to perform impossible motions on the block and the stairs in the virtual 3D world. For example, the character walks between non-contiguous blocks, which seem to be contiguous on the screen.“Constellation” is point-based animation system that generates a character by using several points or metamorphoses a character by using points to construct another character.
