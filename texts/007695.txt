Cyclone.soc brings together two contemporaryphenomena: - severe weather, the project uses weather datathat charts the emergence and progress of hurricanes. - the polarized nature of debate that occurs in certain online newsgroup forums.The project maps textual conversation taken fromthe political and religious newsgroups to theisobars of a dynamic, interactive weather visuali-zation of hurricanes, whose complex structuresare used to visualize the conversational churn andeddies of the newsgroup conversations. In staging these interactions as a process ofmeteorological precipitation, newsgroup conver-sations “condense” in the working environment asa temporal ambient patterning—a structuring thatacts not only as a metonym of difference, but ofideological tensions which mirror the dynamics ofsocial space.Cyclone.soc  is a navigable environment thatgives the user the ability to zoom in or out andskate across and through the cyclonic weatherformations in order to read or be immersed in thenewsgroup text.
