“The Physical Value of Sound” consists of series of products that allow people to realize the physicality of music. Recently, the media that surround us have changed from analog to digital—for instance, photography, film and music. These days, most sounds are recorded only digitally. I feel uneasy about digitalization of music because I wonder if it will survive to the next generation. Digitally based music media is just “data”, in other words, “virtual”. When objects lose physicality, they become virtual. I strongly believe that the record is still the latest and the finest media in analog recording technology. If you think of Edison’s gramophone record, it is clear that records can survive and can be listened to hundreds of years later. The record is the only commonly available, playable media that is physical, and in this project I used this diminished format as the raw material. I hope the experience of this project will provoke people’s interest in this physical music media.
