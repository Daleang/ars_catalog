“Audience” consists of a large crowd of head-size mirror objects. Each object moves its head in a particular way, simulating the most basic different characteristics of human behavior. Some chat amongst themselves, some shy away and others confidently move to grab your attention. When members of the audience enter the perimeter of the installation, the mirrors inquisitively follow anyone they find interesting. Having chosen their subject, they all synchronize and turn their heads towards them. Suddenly that person can see their reflection in all of the mirrors.  They will watch this person until they lose interest, then either seek out another subject or return to their private chatter. The suddenly synchronized collective behavior of the objects is beyond the control of the viewer, as it is left entirely to their discretion to let go of their subject. Conceptually, the installation aimed to reverse the roles of the viewer and the viewed during this involuntary interaction. Would other members of the audience experience the sensation of being ignored or excluded when they were not the center of attention? Would the installation create a feeling of uneasiness and apprehension? The intention was to start taking interaction with an installation further away from the screen or media wall and introduce it into a more physical, threedimensional space, and to begin to investigate whether machines can evoke diverse emotional reactions using the simplest of means. In the first showing of the piece it could be seen that some of the visitors were literally turning into performers, aiming to gain the attention of the mirrors, with the installation becoming their “audience”.
