The Gambiocycle is a mobile broadcast unit—a tricycle fully equipped to project interactive video and digital graffiti into public space. Its construction is inspired by typical Brazilian street salesmen’s trolleys. The Gambiocycle was developed as part of Gambiologia, which is an open-source art movement based on the fusion between technology and “gambiarras”: the Brazilian cultural do-it-yourself practice of solving problems in alternative ways or giving unusual functions to objects. The Gambiologists organize and participate in exhibitions, urban interventions and free workshops on low-tech electronics, waste-made design and object-hacking. Gambiologia is open to anyone interested in the critical, creative and sustainable use of technology and media.
