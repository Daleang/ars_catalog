Since the advent of nuclear power in Germany, two sites have become synonymous with the end of a technological feasibility fantasy: the Kalkar fast-breeder reactor, which was never brought on line, and the Asse II atomic waste storage plant. Dream Water Wonderland transforms the legacy of the nuclear industry into a dream of half-life durations. The installation consists of two Plexiglas cubes placed on top of each other. The upper level houses a futuristic record player from the 1970s. A crystalline tower rises from the center pin. Downwards, through the player itself, into the lower cube, a delicate, scale-model 3D print of the underground Asse II mine rotates like a radar beam. The first sequence of the video projected on the rear panel shows the Kalkar cooling tower, which is now an amusement park. In the second sequence the camera flies inside the tower on a large carousel along the walls and over the edge of the tower into the sky. When the audience comes closer to the installation a sensor gives a signal to the record player, which then autonomously starts playing. The sound inside the cubes, an echolike “Atmosound” of the tower and the dream record playing on the record player, can be heard on headphones hanging in front of the cubes. It tells a dream about a strange, birdlike, blue creature that is made to take up residence with families but which needs incredible amounts of electricity.
