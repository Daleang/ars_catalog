In gravicells, it is possible for us to develop a new human sense by feeling gravity differently than usual and having a new perception of body. The installation provides a space with hypothetical dynamics having the opposing forces of gravity and resistance through special devices and sensors. Walking freely in the site, visitors are able to feel gravity that they are seldom aware of, resistance to it, and the effects caused by other participants. All movements and changes made by participating visitors are transformed into the movements of sound, light (LED) and geometrical images through the sensors, so that the whole space develops or changes in this interactive installation. Additionally, the position of the exhibition space is simultaneously measured by GPS, and with multiple linked GPS satellites as part of it the work involves some observation points outside the earth. That means that the area of our perception has expanded, and presents the fact that this installation site is moving relative to gravity as well. Our sense of direction in a space, up and down or right and left, indicates the fact that we have physical functions in the gravity-based environment, and without it, our concept of space would not be formed. Thus we live in a world where gravity is inevitable, and everything that exists on the earth represents a form controlled by the dynamics of gravity, not to mention a space, language, physique, stomach shape or architecture. This installation provides people with an opportunity to feel the possibility of the dissolution of gravity, which suggests multiple meanings.
