Honda’s Internavi car navigation system designs drivers’ journeys using vehicle log data. Sound of Honda / Ayrton Senna 1989 used 24-year-old Formula One data to bring an Ayrton Senna race back to life in sound and light. The data from the then world’s fastest lap, by Senna in the qualifiers for the 1989 F1 Japanese Grand Prix, was digitally reconstructed and analyzed. By matching this with recordings of MP4/5 cars, reproductions were created of the engine sounds at the time. Installing speakers and LED lights along the 5,807-meter Suzuka circuit, the reproduced engine sounds were paired with motion data from the race. The 1:38:041 lap time was recreated on a website in 3D computer graphics using WebGL (an API for displaying 3D graphics in a browser), enabling viewers to experience Senna’s performance online. A smartphone app also allowed drivers to enjoy the sounds of Senna’s lap in their cars.
