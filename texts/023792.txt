Ever since I embarked on electro-acoustic music, I have sought to create a relation between man and technology. Thus I made compositions for tape and voices or tape and instruments.Fortunately, today even small computers with affordable software offer astonishing capabilities. I have already composed some pieces in my little ”home studio“. It is there that ”Fuji“ was invented, a piece for tape, soprano, dance and live image.Thanks to my friends, the dancer and choreographer Bettina Nisoli and the painter Roman Scheidel, we could represent our ideas of multi-media art. As we had no access to the expensive computers needed for graphics, the images were painted ”live“ on an overhead projector. The painter Roman Scheidl would well like to paint his images in color with computer graphics, if he just had the chance to. A realization of the work with a Paint Box and video projection surely would be much more impressive. (Kyoko Abe)
