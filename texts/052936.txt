This is a music video of “Cold Stares”, a collaboration between Los Angeles-based artist and beatmaker Nosaj Thing, who is actively working around the world, and rapper Chance The Rapper. A dance piece by two dancers was produced to express the message in the lyricstheir mental situation and conflict searching for reason of being and memories, wandering along the border between reality and illusion. This dance has been shown in two ways: the real world performed by people and the delusional world of CG. This film and editing system has potential for capturing various live performance and live sports broadcasts. In the future, we plan to use ultra wide band techniques to capture outdoor spaces, in place of motion capture cameras.
