“Conversation“ is a very important step for me on the way towards independent and original computer art, because of the following: It exploits the interactive possibilities of the computer, and this is something neither film nor video is capable of. In this way, “Conversation“ always remains a constantly changing, live material. Each performance requires total concentration from the artists. It breaks completely with traditional dramaturgy, it is a mass in which you can reach any point from any of the other points.The form of appearance of “Conversation“ (size of pictures projected, localization of audience, volume of sound) depends always on the intentions of the authors and not on external circumstances as blow-up of screen photos or setting of video monitors. By means of relatively simple conversions, “Conversation“ can be performed on several types of cheap machines (EGA, VGA, MCGA, ATARI, AMIGA, VISION 16 etc.). The composition is not attached solely to one type of machines, only to the special software utilized (Film Director Professional). The difference between various performances is similar to that of a piece of music interpreted on instruments of better or worse quality. “Conversation“ has to be never definitively completed, it can always change, moreover, may be performed by different artists as well.
