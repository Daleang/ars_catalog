one of these mornings gonna wake up crazy, gonna take my gun, gonna shoot my baby—ain’t nobody’s business if i do. if i catch you with another man that’s the end little girl. one of these mornings gonna wake up woozy, gonna take my gun gonna kill old suzie. I love you so much it hurts and i’d rather see you dead little girl than be with another man. i’m going out to shoot my old lady, you know i caught her messing round with another man and that ain’t too cool. I killed the only woman i loved—the gun went off a root-ie-toot too-and frankie fell on the floor. it ain’t nobody’s business but my own.it’s an unbelievably realistic world of brutal, senseless, gratuitous, egregious, yet strangely compelling horror.
