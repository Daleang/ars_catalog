Hyperscratch is an interactive installation in which one can control light and sound by moving one's hand within a certain space.There is an invisible three-dimensional interface in front of the participant. Within the interface are twelve horizontal rows, six vertical columns at five levels, front and rear, of invisible switches, 360 in total, which the participant can control by "touching" the switches which in turn operate the light and sounds of a device in front.In front of the participant is a frame 8' in height, 13' wide, and 8' deep in which there are arranged again 360 (12 x 6 x 5) copper pipes with motors and LEDs. As the participant "touches" the invisible switches the pipe which corresponds to that switch emits sound and a light comes on.This endeavors to develop an interface which anyone can operate at will, freely, in a three-dimensional space, as well as produce such an interface which emits light and sound. The objects to be operated are spread out in a three-dimensional space and provide the participant with a new experience, namely to operate a mechanized device in a remote place.The sound activated is not made by a computer but is the sound of a bell (copper tube) hit by a motor and is accompanied by a flashing light; it will be a refreshing change to the ears of people accustomed to hearing computerized or digitalized sound.Computers and digitalized equipment are used to detect hand movement and activate light and sound, but are not seen by the participant. The theme of this object is the physical movement of the participant's hand and the simple but meaningful sound of the copper pipe and the light. This expresses and symbolizes my personal philosophy that computers and other high-tech equipment, as it supports our daily lives, should not have a strong visual presence.
