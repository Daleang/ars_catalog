Make Do and Mend references the 75th anniversary of the first use of penicillin in a human patient in 1941 and takes the form of an altered wartime woman’s suit marked with the British Board of Trade’s utility logo CC41, which stands for ‘Controlled Commodity 1941’. The holes and stains in the suit have been patched with silk stained with pink colonies of E. coli bacteria, grown on dye-containing agar. The genomes of these bacteria have been edited using a technique called CRISPR, to remove an ampicillin antibiotic resistance gene and scarlessly patch the break using homologous recombination with a fragment of DNA encoding the WWII slogan Make Do and Mend. Ampicillin is part of the penicillin group of antibiotics, so with this artistic genomic edit, Dumitriu and Goldberg have used today’s technology to return the organism to its pre-antibiotic era state, reflecting on how we might in future control and protect such biotechnological advances.
