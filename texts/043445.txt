Maquila Región 4 is a performative intervention in the labor landscape of marginal areas of Mexico. It is a mobile factory for the manufacture of electronic-textile artworks. This nomadic workshop travels to poor areas of Mexico offering the American minimum wage ($7.00 per hour, compared to $0.60 per hour in Mexico). People are hired to produce fully functional electronic circuits using conductive thread. The actual textile-schematic circuits produced are alarms which ring with different tones when a proximity sensor is activated. Once a piece is finished, the worker embroiders on it a unique bi-directional (BiDi) code (similar to a quick-response bar code). As the BiDi is decoded, typically by a consumer with a smart phone, a web page appears that shows the production history: name of the worker, location, date and duration of the work session, salary received, a schematic diagram and a “self-representation” section where the worker can add optional information on him or herself, stories, dedications, donations, videos or anything else.
