Located at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C., Sentient Chamber is a free-standing pavilion integrating innovative near-living technologies developed by the Living Architecture Systems Group. Sentient Chamber is composed of a flexible meshwork canopy, housing a network of kinetic mechanisms that use dense arrays of microprocessors and sensors. These interactive systems offer interactions with viewers that include spatially imaged sound, light, and movement mechanisms. A curiosity-based learning algorithm in the software allows the sculpture to be aware of its audience, attempting to learn meaningful behaviors over time. The work explores an architecture capable of handling unstable conditions through artificial intelligence, attempting to offer practical methods for working with our increasingly complex built environment.
