“The Fragmented Orchestra” is a huge distributed musical structure modeled on the firing of the human brain’s neurons. It connected 24 public sites across the UK to form a tiny networked cortex, which adapts, evolves and triggers sitespecific sounds via a central space. Each of the sites has a soundbox installed, which streamed human-made and elemental sounds from the site via an artificial neuron to one of 24 speakers in FACT. The sounds are only transmitted when the neuron fires. A firing event caused fragments of sound to be relayed to the gallery and also communicated to the cortex as a whole. The combined sound of the 24 speakers at the gallery were continuously transmitted back to each of the 24 sites. The sounds of “The Fragmented Orchestra” varied according to location; wind over Black Fell, innercity traffic, chanting from sports stadiums and the chatter of migrating birds arriving for the winter were combined with incidental and performed sounds from members of the public. The public, invited to play the instrument at the 24 sites, were able to hear the effect their playing has on the overall composition of the piece, at each site and at FACT. As members of the public used the instrument they became both player and audience of a vast and evolving musical composition extended across the UK.
