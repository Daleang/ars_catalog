The kinetic sculpture aura calculata weaves a continuously changing microtonal sound carpet by the variation of the water levels in 18 transparent acrylic glass pipes. The triangular growth pattern of a Pacific sea mussel exhibited on a separate column refers to the driving principle behind the sculpture: The tones are created without any directing control instance, but simply by the musical adaption of the self-organization principle of cellular automata. Each pipe has its own electronics that detect whether its neighbors are playing or not. Similar to a football stadium wave, the circularly arranged pipes decide by a simple local rule, how they react to their own and their neighborsâ€™ activity.When a pipe turns active it opens the air valve. The played pitch depends on the regulation of the water flow and the water column rises or falls depending on how active a pipe was during the last steps. This changes the pitch of the played tone over the range of more than an octave, but it also radically changes its timbre.
