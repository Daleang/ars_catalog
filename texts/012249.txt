An interactive video installation created in collaboration with Evian, “The Replenishing Body” consists of a grid of squares (5x5) which can each record a one-second loop of film. Participants can create and orchestrate a giant composite moving creature, or simply a collage of moving snapshots by recording a close-up section of their body part. The grid starts empty at the beginning of the installation and becomes a constantly changing collaborative artwork. Grids were periodically uploaded to a gallery which can be viewed on http://www.showstudio.com/ project/thereplenishingbody. At the close of the project, these final artworks were judged by Nick Knight, who selected the three best video portraits from the whole “Replenishing Body” project. We also invited various fashion celebrities to come to the studio and create more considered portraits.
