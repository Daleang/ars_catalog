Imagine you are buying a ticket at the box office for an individual show on a specific day, but are not led to the auditorium of the theater. Instead, you get the key for a room and a sketch of how to get there. It might be a room in the theater, an office, or an apartment somewhere close by. You open the door and you find a phone ringing. You pick up the phone and a person with a strange accent strikes up a conversation with you. The person seems to know the room you are sitting in, even though he is about 10,000 km away. The voice belongs to a call-center agent from Calcutta, India. He and his colleagues usually sell credit cards and insurance on the phone to people on the other side of the globe or provide navigational help in cities that they have never been to themselves. But this time you are not supposed to buy anything. By now, you are standing at the window and your transcontinental conversation partner is pointing out to you some curious people in the building opposite. On the notebook desktop in your room, images and videos are opening up out of nowhere. A story is about to develop and you realize that the callcenter agent and you and your city are the very first protagonists of the plot.
