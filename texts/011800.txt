Unreflective Mirror is an extended version of a traditional mirror – even the appearance is quite similar to an ordinary mirror. From the technical side it is realized with virtual reality using 3D position tracking and passive stereo projection.However, it is a totally fake mirror. In it, a viewer wearing polarized filter glasses sees the glasses as a reflection, but cannot see themselves. Also, the reflected image of the back walls follows the eye coordination of the viewer. Viewers can experience a strange feeling of the loss of their existence or the feeling of new type of an artificial shadow self.To make this effect stronger, a surveillance camera and a monitor display are added to the room. These instruments are also reflected in the fake mirror. The reflected image on the 3D model of the monitor display in the fake mirror shows video images from the surveillance camera, which are captured in real time through a PC. The viewer can see herself or himself in the display monitor in the fake mirror, but otherwise only the glasses indicating the viewer’s movement can be seen. Only the viewer’s body is missing from the mirror.
