Somnambules is a choreographic and interactive show for the Internet in 12 scenes and their respective preludes. It draws together contact dance, painting, video and music.Dance Contact Improvisation, of which Didier Silhol is one of the forerunners in France, deals with physical laws and human relations through gravity and expansion, altruism and resistance, inertia and impulse, submission and refusal, things which find their resolution in dance.Filmed movements of the dancers are screened on scenery built from painted elements, playing with matter and transparency. Interactive music is composed on the basis of the emotions it renews ad infinitum, confronted with the images. Interactivity, both graphical and musical, places the player at the heart of the choreography. This new artwork has its source in all the short interactive modules conceived and realized by Jean-Jacques Birg√© and Nicolas Clauss on the website flyingpuppet.com.
