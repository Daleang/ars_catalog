The installation ‘The Virtual Cage’ is situated in an auditorium (a ‘Theater am Turm’ production, Frankfurt) approximately 10 m by 20 m. In the middle of the room there is a hydraulically damped glass platform where the viewer can walk around. Two surface mirrors fastened to the platform and tilted at a 45 degree angle reflect a laser beam across the darkened room as a reference plane. Sensors convey the instantaneous inclination of the platform to an Iris-Indigo workstation in the next room. A second Indigo in the theater foyer is connected via a network.A five channel audio system controlled by the Indigo computer system fills the room with sound. In the connecting space between the two rooms there is a 3 m by 4 m rear-projection screen. A video beamer located close to the ceiling of the next room projects real-time computer graphics onto the screen from behind. The same program runs on both computer systems. The databases contain a ‘wire-frame’ model of the room, in which a swarm of dots chase each other around (the creature). The swarm is moved around the room in accordance with the angle at which the platform is tilting under the weight o f the viewer. The swarm is allocated two different sounds which are moved around the room by the audience as a perceptible utterance.The connection between the two computer systems allows two simultaneous ways of seeing:- the viewer finds himself in the ‘computer model’ of the room and sees the creature as a fleeting shadow on the screen.- the viewer sees the whole installation room (virtually) through another camera position (from outside) on the monitor set up in the foyer. The swarm-like creature inside can be seen being chased around the room - interactively - by the viewers. (Christian Moiler)Technical BackgroundHW: SGISW: Custom Software
