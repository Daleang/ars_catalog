In Continuization Loop a single 35mm film loop is pulled up and down over more than 150 guide wheels, creating a wall of film. The frames of this piece of film are only black or transparent. When the loop travels through the mechanism, the image of video static appears. While film as a medium normally makes images appear through projection in combination with the transport of celluloid through a projector, Continuization Loop omits the projection and makes the image appear by means of the transport alone. The installation combines and imitates visual elements from three generations of visual media: the material aspect of film, the empty signal of video and the binary logic of digital. At the same time the most important attributes of these media are absent: there is no construction of an illusory film-space, there is no real video image and there are no computers involved.
