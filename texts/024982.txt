”'Electronic Purgatory' is a Digital Music-Theatre composition. Digital Music-Theatre is an emerging form of multi-disciplinary theatre in which traditional staging agents have been replaced with electro-acoustic instruments and projected visuals. All these constituents are generated and/or controlled 'live' by the performers (interactors) on the stage by means of an interactive multi-computer network. Consequently all elements, both visual and aural, are generated, realized and controlled in real-time without the use of video or audio tape. Structurally the work is divided in five closely meshed movements. The complexity of this event is visualized by the use of two (life-size) video screens (called Video Worlds), each of which is capable of showing a slightly different dynamical system.The almost god-like gestures of the interactors shape the primordial lsoup-of-all-possibilities' into increasingly more intricate and perdurable aural and visual forms. However, in time the physical actions of the interactors become more self-directed and less environmentally oriented.“ (Kristi Allik / Robert Mulder)Technical background:Electronic Purgatory, Digitales Musiktheater, 1991HW: 2 Amiga, Live Digitalizers; 1 Amiga or Mac Computer, Midi NetworkSW: Mandala, Midi-Mice, Bars and Pipes, M, Sound Quest, Arexx, D-Paint III, Audio Master III, Soundscape
