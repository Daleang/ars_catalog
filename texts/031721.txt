Algorithmic art production is aesthetically superior to the traditional methods which rely on the creative imagination of human persons. It is not constrained by the conventional ideas of human artists, or tainted by their often embarrassing ulterior motives. The Institute of Artificial Art is therefore committed to the development of fully automatic algorithmic art in all artistic genres.In music and visual art, the success of the algorithmic approach is well established now; we have developed several algorithms which create rewarding works of art without requiring human interference. Applying the algorithmic approach to the production of computer-controlled dance and theatre performances is, however, still a major challenge: it requires a close collaboration between machines and human persons, in which the human participants cannot seize control of the situation to use it for their own expressive purposes. We intend to solve this problem by developing technological methods for controlling the movements of the muscles of human dancers and actors in complete detail.Pilot experiments have shown that the body part which constitutes the most important human display device is the human face. Initially we have therefore focused our research completely on the computational control of the human facial muscles.
