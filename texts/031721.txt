"Moppet" is a new creative system that anyone can use. It is simple, easy and open. People can paint and make music at the same time. The system is networked through a telecommunications network. It links many participants and several spaces.Anyone can do it, because it is not difficult, but easy to use. It involves networked cooperation, multi-users, multi-spaces. The performance may be seen by a large audience."Moppet" creates CG paintings according to the way the participants move. The movement on "Moppet's" court takes the place of a paintbrush. The painting is projected to a screen over the court. All the participants share the same canvas.The sound is generated by the movements of the participants, too. The participants are able to make music and paintings at the same time.No one needs to wear special equipment. The system is wireless. Each participant handles different colored balls that may be simply handed to the other participants.There is something ambivalent about "Moppet". We feel that the participants' activities on the "Moppet's" courts demonstrate communication and miscommunica-tion. Our intention is to clearly represent the great difficulties involved in collaboration in networked spaces of creativity.With the "Moppet" and its activities, we are attempting to make an open creative system using networks."Moppet" was produced and designed by Toshihiro Anzai (art direction, software), Tamio Kihara (produce, system design), Koichi Fujii (sound design, software), Hiroyuki Moriwaki (interface design), Nobuya Suzuki (communication design) and Rieko Nakamura (visual design).
