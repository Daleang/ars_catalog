The installation "Parallel Mesmerization of Eleven Blondes and Eleven Brunettes by Two Computers" interacts with the organism of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow Jones represents an organic virtual species made up of pure quantity: the stock quotes of the 30 largest American companies. Dow Jones' life signs are distributed all over the world and easily accessed by downloading the quotes from the Internet. (Almost) everyone can be part and influence the behavior of this being, but only to a small degree - the investment. The piece does not simulate the stock market but (ab)uses the life signs of the Dow Jones as a trigger for audio-visual events, or in a more generic sense - mass behavior as an inspiration for the arts. Two teams of dolls are placed on the soccer field model (blonde team/brunette team). A computer controls the behavior of the teams. Each doll is linked to the actions of a particular Dow Jones' stock. Every 15 minutes the computer logs into a stock quote provider on the Internet and downloads quotes. Changes in the stocks' values cause the dolls' actions: breasts flash, they speak (samples from kids tales and pornographic tapes) and sing, etc. Little motors move the figures in random patterns across the field - a strange ballet of singing blondes and brunettes with flashing breasts performs a hybrid theater piece conducted by the the Dow Jones' virtual organism.
