Long ago in history was the belief that the four elements–fire, wind, water, and earth–could combine together as one to birth a never before known substance. Today, this is an unrealistic fantasy, however, by incorporating the latest in technology, the designer imagined the future of clothing in this collection.In the near future, textiles will be made for the individual who wears it. By function, aesthetics, touch, form, and other factors, clothing will be able to transform instantaneously. Eventually, in fashion, no two garments will be the same.This is based on a long-term project towards a vision for the future in which Yuima Nakazato would like to realize: “to each individual, his own design”. lf clothing can be created without being sewn, the concept of designing, manufacturing, and distribution will change greatly. Designing for specific individuals will be made possible. Each item in this collection is created without a single thread or needle, each formed simply of thousands of components, which we name Units. The patterns depicted show the Units that make up each piece.
