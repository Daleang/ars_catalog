Voices of Aliveness invites people to ride a bicycle on a special path called the “shouting circuit” prepared exclusively for this project and asks them to shout out loud. The bicycles are equipped with a GPS recorder and a video camera. As participants ride the bicycle, traces of their path and shouts are transformed in cyberspace into the shape of ring. Voices of Aliveness is a collection of the shouts of the participants. It is a sculpture of voices. It is a “meta-monument” made of collective memory. The collected rings from each participant are compiled to form a tower-like “time tunnel”—a cyber tunnel of collected shouting that extends toward the heavens. The experience is documented on the Web.The project connects real space with virtual space. It asks how we can give expression to our lives, our sense of being alive and our activities in virtual space, as well as how we can convey our actions as collective memory to the Internet. Our only option is to invent a new means of expression and develop our creativity. The participants’ shouts are the key to connecting technology and memory.
