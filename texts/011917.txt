Over the years, the development of video games has been trying its best to produce a virtual-reality experience getting ever closer to reality. By changing the interface, from Atari’s joystick to the analog vibration of the PS2 joystick, then a gun-shaped controller for a shooting game and Dance Mania’s floor controller for the Wii wiimote, video-game design is creating a more and more “physical experience” for the players. Players can now actually smash and swing to play the game, but we are still playing the games in a 2D virtual environment: manipulating the character in an unlimited virtual space in a fixed, static, limited real world. “Moving Mario” is definitely not reproducing Super Mario Bros in another way. By grabbing a partial concept and some of the key elements behind the TV game development, “Moving Mario” is trying to challenge some of the traditional game elements. Throughout the gaming process, players can rethink the relationship between the player and the game.
