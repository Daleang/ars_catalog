The installation “Machine Dreams” uses video to trigger zones of individual sound samples. It is an interactive installation that uses the reaction of the participant to the visual component of the space to produce a soundscape.The visual component refers to visions of technological Utopia, demonstrated by four modified machines taken from the lives of four women in history. These machines are: a sewing machine (1900), a typewriter (1940), a mixmaster (1960), a telephone switchboard (1990).Four graphic images, displayed on a wall, provide the connection between the technology on display and the body. The sound composition reflects the Utopian dreams of each era and the technology itself.Technical BackgroundSound: sponsored by Perceptive Systems, Melbourne, Australia; 3DIS Music System; proprietary software & hardware; 4 monochrome video surveillance cameras; host PC; 4 video framegrabbers (Vista and Matrox PIP); RGB monitor; Roland MPU401 synthesiser controller; MIDI based synthesisers and samplers.
