“I expect the computer to inspire me by the way it organizes data, by its similarity to „Nature", by its independence that still depends on the interaction with Man. These elements, too, may be found in sculptures: the sculpture must give up being a singular object that is not repeatable, on the contrary, it is an object among objects always in connection with similar things. Containing a certain amount of information, it must interact with the viewer, which is as important as is the sound. „Suoni di Plastica" is the title of an installation of sound sculptures that were presented in Milan at Fondazione MUDIMA on May 2, 1991.Simple mass-produced plastic objects, such as buoys, floats, pipes, bottles and containers, are the elements that make up the sound sculptures once they are combined. The trimmers on each circuit extend to the outside of the plastic objects, and the audience may manipulate them, thus modifying sounds and voices. The duration, the timbre, the note, the number and the frequency of repetition can be varied for every sound. By this intervention, the audience becomes an integrated part of the work and creator of the aesthetical audio event.” (Ale Guzzetti)Technical background:Suoni die Plastica – Skulpturen im KonzertCourtesy Mudima Milano, 1990HW: self-constructed electronic circuits
