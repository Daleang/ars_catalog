It’s 2012, so why are humans still menstruating? As a female artist I had one intriguing question I wanted to solve. When the contraceptive pill first became commercially available in the 1960s, it was deliberately designed to have one pill-free, menstruating week every month. This was because the doctors felt that female users would find having no periods too worrying and unacceptable. 50 years have passed since then, and modern technology has accomplished even more—space travel, mobile phones, the Internet, cloning and genetically modified food—but women are still bleeding. New pills such as Lybrel and Seasonique, which reduce the frequency of menstruation to none or four times a year have recently been developed, but they are not yet widely used. For example in Japan, it only took the ministry of health six months to approve Viagra, but it took them more than nine years to approve the contraceptive pill in 1999 (which was approved three months after the approval of Viagra). It is quite clear that the advancement of technology can be heavily influenced by political, social and cultural backgrounds of the time. So what does menstruation mean to humans, biologically, culturally and historically? Who might choose to have it, and how might they have it? The Menstruation Machine—fitted with a blood dispensing mechanism and electrodes simulating the lower abdomen—stimulates the pain and bleeding of a five-day menstruation process.
