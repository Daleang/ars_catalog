A ball-shaped theater is made of a transparent membrane with 12 burning-point inductors in it. Spectators in the theater can light the fire ports to trigger a jet of flame. The flames change from weak to strong until they touch the dome and last for five minutes before turning into thick smoke. Then the flame can be re-ignited. The more spec-tators participate, the stronger the flame and the longer it will last until it touches the sky dome and the Globe Fire becomes a real fireball. Inside the dome there are 12 temperature sensors, each on a 1.6m-high metal stand. Each sensor has two functions: one shows the current temperature, the other is the temperature that can turn on the image of flames. The whole 360 degrees of the dome is covered by the image from five projectors. Visitors can interact with the artwork by lighting up the temperature sensor and turning on the image of flames. The flags of 200 countries can be seen inside the image of the flames.
