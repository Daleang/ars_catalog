Essentially the “Red Psi Donkey” project consists of a shape created by wave patterns and visualized by the use of an “acoustic camera”. A sound is produced that creates a shape. The sound is inaudible (ultrasonic). The shape is invisible. It is the shape of a red donkey. The wave pattern, which looks like a red donkey, only exists as long as the waves can unfold uninterruptedly within the empty exhibition space. It can be observed on a monitor / screen outside. As soon as audience enters the exhibition space, the wave pattern naturally changes. The image of the red donkey disappears. Entering the sound space causes the image to dissolve. The “Red Psi Donkey”deals with an unreachable reality that only occurs in the moments of the absence of audience. The interactivity in the immediate reality lies beyond human senses. The layer of perception is dislocated. The observation of the interactivity denies participation.The installation / realizationThe “Red Psi Donkey”consists of two room segments: an audio segment and a segment for visualization. The acoustic segmentThe sound sources: the wave pattern is constructed using a speaker array of several hundred small speakers. The sound detector: an acoustic camera, which allows the observation of sound waves (amplitude distribution) within the space, picks up the red donkey pattern and displays it. The sound: the sound generating the donkey pattern is an ultrasonic noise field, inaudible to the human ear. The visual part / the monitorA flat-screen monitor is placed at the center of the installation. Its reverse side faces the sonic segment of the space. If there is no audience in the sonic half of the space the monitor displays the images produced by the acoustic camera, the wave pattern of the “red psi donkeys”. If the audience speaks or enters the sonic segment their physical presence will dissolve the wave pattern. The image provided by the acoustic camera turns into something abstract.
