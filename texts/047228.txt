Ishin-denshin is a Japanese idiom which denotes the traditional concept of interpersonal communication through unspoken mutual understanding. This four-character compound, known as a yojijukugo, literally translates as “what the mind thinks, the heart transmits.” Sometimes explained in English in terms of telepathy or sympathy, ishin-denshin is also commonly rendered as “heart-to-heart communication” or “tacit understanding.” (Source: Wikipedia)The Ishin-Den-Shin installation addresses physicality and intimacy in digital audio communication. It consists is a microphone that can record sounds and transmit them through touch. Once recorded, the sound is transformed into an inaudible signal. This is transmitted to a person’s body when they hold the microphone. The signal can be transmitted by physical contact from body to body. The recorded sound becomes audible only when touching someone’s ear. The sound can be heard only by the ear that is touched, as if the finger were whispering the recorded sounds. Secrets, messages and whispers can then be transmitted from person to person in physical contact with each others. Bodies become a broadcasting medium for intimate, physical, sound communication.
