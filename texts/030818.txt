"Cross-active System" is a modified virtual reality system, in which the motion input from one participant provides sensory feedback to the other participant. In an ordinary interactive system, a user obtains sensory feedback in response to his/her own motion input. In "Cross-active System", two participants experience unusual communication by dividing the sensory feedback from their motion input. The "Cross-active System" installation consists of a motion platform capable of moving up to six degrees in any direction, with a large screen in front of it, and a micro-video camera with a position sensor. One participant sits on the motion platform and the other participant holds the micro-video camera. The image from the camera is displayed on the big screen, while the motion from the micro-video camera is tracked by the position sensor. Since the data from the position sensor controls the motion platform, a slight motion of the micro-video camera results in a large motion on the part of the motion platform. The sensory experience of the participant on the motion platform is controlled by the other participant in a ratio of 1/100.
