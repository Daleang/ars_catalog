Did you ever get a compliment about your smell when you were not wearing a perfume? Many individuals are highly sensitive to the smell of a component of body odor and sweat called androstenone. These people do not like the smell; they compare it to urine or perspiration. They decide whether or not they like a person based on smell.I chose to work with men because their sweat contains a lot of androstenone. Nineteen men (bodies) from 19 different parts of the world have only one thing in common: they all suffer from a severe phobia – THE FEAR OF OTHER BODIES. Each man was given a special electronic device to carry all the time. During a fear attack he was to place it under his armpit to suck in his sweat. The collecting pad from the device was sent to me overnight. I analyzed and simulated the original sweat using headspace technology in my lab, Re_searchLab, Berlin.The sweat molecules were then reproduced chemically. The manufactured smell molecules were microencapsulated in tiny bubble units. The FEAR of smell The smell of FEARThe sweat smell bubbles have been integrated into a transparent, smell-neutral binder used to “paint” the walls. Only touching (the wall/the body) can break the bubbles and release the smells. The smells have all been placed next to each other without any clear borders, like bodies next to each other. They are only separated by the numbers found in the top left corner of each “portrait.”
