The Architecture of Radio is a location based immersive 360ยบ visualization of the Infosphere, the man-made ecosystem of wireless infrastructure. We are completely surrounded by an invisible system of data cables and radio signals from access points, cell towers, and overhead satellites. Our digital lives depend on these very physical systems for communication, observation, and navigation. The app visualizes this network of networks by reversing the ambient nature of the infosphere; hiding the visible while revealing the hidden technological landscape we interact with through our devices. By revealing the defining infrastructure of this time, the Architecture of Radio hopes to inspire a relation between ourselves and the technological world we are building.The Architecture of Radio is a data visualization, based on global open datasets of cell tower, Wi-Fi, and satellite locations. Based on your GPS location the app shows a 360-degree visualization of signals around you. The dataset includes almost 7 million cell towers, 19 million Wi-Fi routers, and hundreds of satellites.
