Data might be accessible almost everywhere via the Internet, but it is actually stored or “lives” at a particular geographical location. Just the last node of a network remains comprehensible to the user: the LAN jack, a modem, a mobile phone, etc…In addition to the network of cables, a dense wireless network covers today’s settled areas, overlapping data-bubbles as big as their radius of range. The aim of decoy is to pinpoint certain spots in this invisible data space. These spots themselves in turn reference the “real” urban space.To do so, small Bluetooth servers with a radio range of about 10 meters are set up in public space. These servers communicate with Bluetoothenabled-devices (e.g. mobile phones, PDAs or laptops) which happens to pass by. If the owner of these passing-by-devices wants to, he or she will receive a picture.In this respect, a decoy is something like an invisible poster, graffiti or a signpost, manifesting itself first via a mobile in someone’s pocket.
