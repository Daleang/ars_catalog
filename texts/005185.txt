10x 10™ (ten by ten) is an interactive exploration of the words and pictures that define the time. The result is an often moving, sometimes shocking, occasionally frivolous, but always fitting snapshot of our world. Every hour, 10 x 10 collects the 100 words and pictures that matter most on a global scale, and presents them as a single image, taken to encapsulate that moment in time. Over the course of days, months, and years, 10x 10 leaves a trail of these hourly statements which, stitched together side by side, form a continuous patchwork tapestry of human life.Each hour is presented as a picture postcard window, composed of 100 different frames, each of which holds the image of a single moment in time. Clicking on a single frame allows us to peer a bit deeper into the story that lies behind the image. In this way we can dart in and out of the news, understanding both the individual stories and the ways in which they relate to each other. 10 x 10 runs with no human intervention, autonomously observing what a handful of leading international news sources are saying and showing. 10 x 10 makes no comment on news media bias, or lack thereof. It has no politics, nor any secret agenda; it simply shows what it finds.With no human editors and no regulation, 10 x 10 is open and free, raw and fresh, and consequently a unique way of following world events. In 10 x 10, we respond instinctively to patterns in the grid, visual indicators of relevance. When we see a frequently repeated image, we know it’s important. Scanning a grid of pictures can be more instructive than reading headlines, for it lets the news come to life, and everything feels a bit less distant, a bit closer to heart, and maybe, if we’re lucky, gives us pause to think.
