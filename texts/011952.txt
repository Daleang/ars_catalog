In this work, when the user’s hands are held out, a set of images is projected onto the palms: a scrolling tanka poem and a single Chinese character representing each tanka. Tanka, meaning “short song”, is a traditional form of Japanese poetry. It is a short verse of 31 syllables, containing five syllabic units (5-7-5-7-7 syllables). Tanka is written down as a sequence of letters, ordinarily presented on paper to be read. The impression of a tanka depends more or less on how the reader perceives and interprets it. Thus, it can be said, that a tanka is finalized as a literary work by the reader. Reflecting this idea, we created a new method of reading that can enhance the reader’s imagination. Unlike a flat surface such as paper, a person’s palm has volume and texture. When a scrolling tanka is projected onto the bumpy surface of the palm, a tactile sensation is evoked, giving a tangible presence to the image, which in reality has no material substantiality. By giving a tangible presence to the tanka, we intend to stimulate the imagination of the reader and hope to go deeper into his or her mind.
