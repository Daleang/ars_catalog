Looking into our lives, I comment on the social voyeurism of the mass media.For my work I use the apartment, the typical, uniform space for our lives. With it I form a database of diverse news articles and information, private lives and documentary material transmitted through mass media such as television, radio, and the Internet. I then allow viewers to participate in, peep at, and hear them! If we peep into other people’s homes, we may feel we are committing a sin. How about the world we live in now? Whether by our own will or someone else’s we get to see what we do not want to see, and we get to hear what we do not want to hear. We enter so deeply into the other person’s private life through the mass media. Despite or due to this, do our conversations become more superficial?  The audience is allowed to freely search the daily life of each home, using telescopes positioned opposite them on the balcony. When the audience focuses on one point, a secret scene appears in close up. The audience’s experience becomes active, as though they were involved in the lives of the people they are observing. The audience is able to see a couple arguing, or in the privacy of their bed. While overlapping with other people’s daily lives through this experience, the audience is able to glimpse the pleasures and sorrows, happiness and fears of people, all events related to our own lives, including bizarre things that happen when there is impersonal and discontinued communication. At the same time, the audience is made aware of the fact that we live in a society inundated with random bits of information, while facing disclosed individual details against our will.
