The virtual being: created by virtual reality technology, enclosed in a white container reminiscent of an incubator or sarcophagus. It responds to human speech with movement, sounds, or by changing its shape. It may be observed through a narrow viewing device with a microphone mounted below it. The installation "RESIDENT" relates to myths and legends about the creation of artificial life. Its design was inspired by methods of alchemy. The body form, the immaterial field of light, and the behaviour of the creature are precisely defined by numbers (key numbers are: one, two, four and seven).
