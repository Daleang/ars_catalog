“When laughter trips at the threshold of the divine” explores and subverts the public use of a public space, exploring the architectural folly through the simplest of interactive concepts, the switch, as represented by the door. With equal nods to Minimalism’s aesthetics and mega-consumerism’s spectacle, the project places a fully functioning automatic sliding door in the middle of a public park, offering the everyday as a folly for play, re-experience and reflection on neutered thresholds.
