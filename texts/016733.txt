“Mortal Engine” is a performance work created in 2007/8 by the company Chunky Move under the direction of Gideon Obarzanek and a team of outstanding artists working in areas that already placed interdisciplinarity at the core of their creative processes. It is not a dance work, nor is it a piece of theater, or a piece of digital music. It is neither an interactive work nor a synaesthetic experience. In essence, it is all of these things melded together to create an exploratory hybridity, a coalescence of human and technological forms. The work is in flux: “Mortal Engine” has a hybridity that results in a series of simultaneously existing states that are yet to collapse into a singularity. Even gravity is compromised as dancers attempt to navigate a sloped stage area that doubles as a modular projection surface. In “Mortal Engine”, the limits of the human body are an illusion. Kinetic energy fluidly metamorphoses from the human figure into light image, into sound and back again in a constant state of becoming. Emanating from within, crackling light and staining shadows represent the most perfect or sinister of souls. Connection and disconnection, isolation and togetherness, duets are seen both as couples and as singular selves struggling to escape inner darkness— mortality, sexuality, desire. Drawing on the kinetics of the interior, enveloping lasers and movement-responsive video projections paint an ever-shifting, shimmering world. Witnessing moments of exquisite cosmological perfection or grotesque evolutionary accidents of existence, we are ceaselessly driven forwards by the reality of permanent change.
