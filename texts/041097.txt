Particles is an illumination installation of seemingly floating lights that create a fantastic after-image. The work centers around an organically spiral-shaped rail construction with a number of balls with built-in LEDs rolling along it while blinking at different intervals, resulting in spatial drawings of light particles in all kinds of shapes. The illumination’s three-dimensional design, achieved through a fusion of the rail construction’s characteristic features and communication control technology, takes on various appearances depending on the viewer’s position. One after another, balls with a built-in LED pass through the rail’s “8-spiral shape.” We see this phenomenon as “light particles floating around”, because the balls radiate at various timings. The position of each ball is determined by 17 control points on the rail. Whenever a ball passes through one of them its positional information is transmitted via a built-in infrared sensor. While the ball is traveling between control points its position is calculated based on its average speed. The data to regulate the balls’ luminescence is divided by the control-point segments and switched whenever a ball passes a control point. The audiences can select a shape from several patterns floating in aerial space using the display’s interface. The activation of the virtual balls on the screen is determined by the time at which a ball passes through a check point on the rail and the speed, which is calculated by using average speed values. The sound is generated from the ball positions and the information from the LED flash pattern and is played through eight-channel speakers.
