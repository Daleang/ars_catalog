Demi-Pas is a short film and is projected using a “reversed camera” technique. A projector has been converted to house micro-mechanisms that produce animated images using a principle similar to that of cinematography. Demi-Pas thus finds its own narrative methods, its own action and images, like a kind of projected theater. Real objects and photographic material are transposed within the projector.Based on this experimental form of projection, the film narrates a tale that has an extremely simple storyline: one man’s daily routine. Demi-Pas is a short film that constructs an everyday reality, thus highlighting simultaneously both the simplicity and the complexity of this reality.
