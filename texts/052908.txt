RGB|CMYK Kinetic is a poetic experience of color, movement, and sound. Simultaneously a suspended sculpture and a choreography of light and music, it has roots in two twentieth-century avant-garde traditions: kinetic art and light art. The inspiration for the work stems from the nature of light, particularly from the duality of additive and subtractive colors. Five mirror-coated flat disks seem to float through space in unison. Three spot lights in the three primary colors, red, green and blue (RGB), project a circle of white light on the floor. The discs reflect the light and cast colored shadows onto the floor. This set-up provides the basis for a poetic choreography and the immersive, spatial experience of colorful, synchronized lights and shadows moving in unison with the computative and weightless motion of the discs.The colored ellipses on the ground are generated by reflecting and shadowing the spot lights. The mirror discs cast shadows behind them on the ground, and in these shadows the white light subtracts into cyan, magenta and yellow (CMY). In front, the discs reflect the RGB light as individual colors onto the ground. With this the three additive primary colors (RGB) and the three subtractive primary colors (CMY) are created out of the white light.The kinetic choreography is complemented by a musical score that unfolds in dialogue with the discs’ movements. The three-part sound composition for RGB|CMY Kinetic was made by Icelandic musician, Ólafur Arnalds. The first part of the composition is based on the movements of the mirror discs: the varying heights of the discs in space modulate the five digital instruments. The following two sections of the composition interpret the computatively designed choreography more freely.
