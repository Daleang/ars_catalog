The Center for PostNatural History is a public outreach organization that examines the changing relationship between culture, nature and biotechnology. The postnatural refers to the life forms that have been intentionally altered by humans through domestication, selective breeding and genetic engineering. This expansive definition begins with the origination of agriculture and the domestication of animals, and today includes genetic engineering, industrial food production, indoor horticulture, ecosystem engineering, hobby pet breeders, biological weapons programs, gene therapy, reproductive control methodology, biofactory silk production, ballistic pumpkin cultivation, flu vaccines and synthetic biology to name just a few. In an effort to catalog this rapidly changing landscape, the CPNH maintains a collection of living, preserved and documented specimens of PostNatural origin. The Center for PostNatural History is currently opening a permanent exhibition facility for this collection and the related exhibitions that address the wide range of postnatural organisms that exist today. This facility is the first biological exhibit space of its kind, with a mandate to exhibit only life forms that have been intentionally altered by humans. In this way, the CPNH is encouraging the viewing of human culture through the lens of the living; the cultural footprint within the biological. The facility houses the CPNHâ€™s existing specimen collection, consisting of hundreds of samples of genetically and developmentally modified insects, plants, worms, bacteria and fish. Additionally, thematic exhibits utilize video, stereoscopic macro photography, taxidermy and dioramas to engage the complex cultural landscape of postnatural life. The Center for PostNatural History is open Sundays and by appointment.
