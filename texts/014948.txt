“Watch Me!” is an experimental project dedicated to documenting social binding by intervening in a public space. It observes the different behavior of people’s “eyes” using a robot bear as an unusual event.If you are staying a country for the first time, you may be puzzled by people’s behavior as they respond to incidents or encounters. Then you might realize that though they seem to behave spontaneously they are predisposed to exhibit certain behavioral traits by society and culture. We call this “social binding”.Furthermore, how does society react when an unusual event happens? Do the police come? Does some local authority force us to clear out or make a detour? Does someone like a gangster make us donate something? Does no one complain? A teddy-bear-like robot is the main performer in the project. It looks cute, but has been programmed to move with difficulty and awkwardly. The robot is put on a street in various cities to watch the behavior of passers by. Three hi-definition camcorders mounted below the robot and covering 180 degrees record the reactions of passers by. Only the area around the eyes is extracted from the movies; other areas are blurred. These effects are applied by a custom program written in C++.Through the “Watch Me!”  project, we are asking you not only to observe social binding and cultural differences in local areas but also to contemplate the boundaries of privacy.
