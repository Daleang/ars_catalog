Rain Room is a 100-square-meter field of falling water through which it is possible to walk, trusting that a path can be navigated without being drenched in the process. As you progress through the exhibition space, the sound of water and a suggestion of moisture fill the air, before you are confronted by a carefully choreographed downpour that responds to your movements and presence.
