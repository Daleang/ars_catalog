In a time in which digital cultural assets far outweigh analog assets, the ease with which we can now amass and exchange material has resulted in large personal collections of media data (music, films, series and so on). Julian Palacz has devised and developed a search engine that can use text input to search personal film and video archives for spoken language. Thus his own collection of films has become a database of keywords, and any spoken word or phrase in it can serve as the basis for a search. If you enter a sentence, e.g. “i love her”, the film or video footage containing this phrase is found and shown in sequence. Thus the selection of keywords is what determines the process of resequencing images and sound in the available film material. _algorithmic search for love_creates an algorithm that opens up new possibilities of audio-visual narratives for viewers.
