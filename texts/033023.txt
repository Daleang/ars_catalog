Xchange Net Audio Network - for alternative non-commercial Internet broadcasters and individual audio content providers, for the exchange and linking of audio content within the net.space, - promoting a net.audio network community.  The Xchange project was initiated by the E-LAB team (Riga) - Rasa Smite, Raitis Smits, Janis Garancs. The content has been developed in collaboration with alternative net.broadcasters from all over the world. The Xchange idea started with an on-line project (in 1997) - monthly Xchange compilations on exchanging and linking real-time audio content within the net. The content emerged out of contributed sound material and links  http://ozone.re-lab.net/Xchange.  The Xchange mailing list, which has been on-line since December 1997, was set up to work on the idea of developing the net.radio community. More info available at  http://Xchange.re-lab.net/mailinglist, mailing list web-archive  http://Xchange.re-lab.net/a.  The Xchange mailing list is used to exchange information and develop collaborative ideas. The most exciting idea developed thanks to the Xchange list is X-OPEN channel - a space for live net.radio and co-broadcasting experiments (Online - at radio OZOne every Tuesday night).  Recently E-LAB & Xchange Network published the first printed issue of Acoustic.Space (which should soon be online as well).
