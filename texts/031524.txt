The Dragon Palace is an underwater paradise described in the Japanese legend "Urashima Taro". This Dragon Palace has been recreated in Okinawa fashion. The buildings, dancers' movements, and their costumes have been designed to realistically resemble Okinawa tradition.Our policy when creating VRML data is to keep file sizes as small as possible while building high quality worlds. The environments of VRML viewers are not universal: direct connection, dial-up using modems, speedy workstations, slow personal computers.To reach the largest common denominator, we need to set our target to the low end machines.
