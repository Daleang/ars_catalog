LightType is an installation questioning links between printed design and interactive design. Its main component is a cube made out of LEDs. Depending on which sides are on, we can create letters. The three-dimensional structure becomes a two-dimensional reading space. The installation fetches tweets about a specified subject. When a message is tweeted, the structure reacts to it and creates each letter of each word. They are all captured on a webcam and the message is then projected on the wall to create a virtual poster.
