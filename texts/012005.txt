In the installation “a plaything for the great observers at rest”, the audience can control the viewpoint and switch between a geocentric model and a heliocentric model by operating the device, a conceptual model of the sun and the earth. But the operation of a moving eye is a kind of privileged power, which the unmoving observer can achieve using only paper and pen, a telescope and his own imagination. The act of re-adjusting the core of the world is a truly dynamic and exciting experience, but only in the conceptual phase. This concept led me to call this artwork “plaything”.
