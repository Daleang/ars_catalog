Hotel Medea is a collaboration between the Brazilian / British Zecora Ura Theatre Network and the London-based Persis-Jade Maravala. The piece has been four years in the making through an ongoing training practice, residencies across the globe with local and international artists and extended research and development period.The collaboration was born out of a desire to create theater that stretches beyond the ordinary boundaries of time and place, insisting on radical audience interaction, participation and immersion.Incorporating live performance and music, multimedia and communication technology and a reinterpretation of the myth, Hotel Medea challenges notions of the theater. This unique experience lasts from midnight till dawn. Spaces and perceptions are transformed, performers and the public feast together at the break of dawn in a triumph against the night.
