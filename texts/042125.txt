Cinema for Primates is a series of videos designed and presented for chimpanzees at Edinburgh Zoo. Chimpanzees in captivity are shown television as a form of enrichment, but no artists have made videos expressly for chimps. After showing a series of test videos to the chimps to learn their preferences, the artist will script and produce a synthetic chimpanzee drama. The video will be installed at the zoo, so that both human and non-human primates can simultaneously watch the show and each other’s responses to it. The project is intended to imagine the inner world of the captive chimpanzee, producing an original artwork—enrichment for humans and chimpanzees.Cinema for Primates is an interspecies art and science project and represents the culmination of a five-year project by Mayeri called Primate Cinema, exploring the linkages between primates and media, which has involved a range of videos, installations, lectures, writing, and workshops, exhibited internationally and sponsored by residencies. The project is interdisciplinary, a collaboration between Rachel Mayeri, a video artist and media studies professor, and Dr. Sarah Jane Vick, a comparative psychologist based at the University of Stirling, who has studied chimpanzee personality, emotions and face recognition. Dr. Vick’s role is to explain and interpret chimpanzee behavior in response to the videos, in addition to input from zookeepers and research assistants.
