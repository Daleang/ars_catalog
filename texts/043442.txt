Radioortung—Radio Plays for Walkers is a newly developed series of radio plays for mobile phones, designed and produced by Deutschlandradio Kultur. These radio plays tell stories that are non-linear and linked to locations, as well as also reflecting the latest mobile technology, in order to create an awareness of the everyday, often hidden interventions into the listener’s everyday life through localization, data collection and storage. The radio plays can be experienced within the city using the free, downloadable Radioortung app (Android) as well as online on the interactive map (_dradio-ortung.d_e). The idea behind Radioortung was explicitly not to recreate a geo-caching event or a location-based adaptation of a novel. Rather, the radio-drama department wanted to react artistically to the new mobile technologies in such a way that the technology itself becomes a player within the individual stories. The second project in the Radioortung series, 50 Kilometres of Files: A Walk-In Stasi Radio Drama,   was produced by the Rimini Protokoll theatrical collective. More than 50 kilometers of files are stored in the central archives of the federal commission for the Stasi records. Protocols of actions, meetings, discussions. From this material, Rimini Protokoll developed a site-specific radio play, in which the subjects of former observations approach their files at the site of observation. About a hundred people were interviewed and recall or reconstruct observations on microphone. What do the observation protocols sound like at the site where they were recorded for those who were observed at the time, and how quickly can one switch from being uninvolved to becoming an active player? Dealing with the role of the surveillance authority is a matter for the strollers and online visitors themselves—in search of the audio portals in the city beneath the city. And while the listeners walked through this audible, highly subjective archive, they were being observed.
