Global capitalism has produced hundreds of millions of bored office workers who sit in front of computers forwarding emails and surfing the web, inadvertently creating the “Bored at Work Network” (BWN). The BWN has become the largest alternative to the corporate media.Activists, artists, and hackers can reach millions of people through the BWN. We are a small group dedicated to creating content for the BWN, including email forwards, net art, joke web sites, phone lines, and weblogs. The Contagious Media Project consists of four initiatives that have reached millions of people: the Nike Sweatshop Emails, the Rejection Line, Black People Love Us, and Fundrace.org. This quartet illustrates the practical application of concepts like emergence, 6-degrees of separation, and tipping points. The work starts small and spreads virally to millions of people without any promotions, advertisements, or press releases. In the end, the mass media picks up the story as a trend, and the work is able to permeate the culture at multiple levels. This lowbudget, bottom-up approach makes it possible to create a global cascade that begins with a small group of friends and extends to the set of CNN or the Today Show. The Contagious Media Project suggests new opportunities for artists and activists in the networked age.
