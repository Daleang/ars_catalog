“Cosmic Revelation” is a minimalist light-art projectand a scientific experiment as well. In a field of 16 flashing mirror sculptures connected to the Kascade detector field at the Forschungszentrum [Research Center] Karlsruhe (Germany) the impact of high-energy cosmic rays on the earth can be experienced at first hand. “Cosmic Revelation” is presented directly in the detector field, but also remotely in other places. As a new kind of land art, the flashing field not only refers to the physical processes in matter, but also indicates the protecting and moderating qualities of the atmosphere as basic condition for the existence of a biosphere on earth.
