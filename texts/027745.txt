The work 'Handsight' was produced in cooperation with the Center for Art and Media Technology, Karlsruhe, and premiered at Ars Electronica in 1992. The point of the piece is to emphasize aspects of virtuality, realization and assimilation of the senses through telepresence, and to connect the real with the virtual by relating a specific physical object to its virtual properties.This is achieved through a three-part installation: a projection screen for real-time computer graphics and an interactive, handheld user interface in the shape of an eyeball with which the user explores the surroundings and interior of a larger, hollow plexi-glass sphere. This 'eyeball' becomes a disembodied object in the user's hand - a virtual camera moving freely in space. When pointed at the outside of the hollow sphere, this virtual camera displays it as an eyeball, through whose pupil it can enter and 'explore' the interior where virtual pictures and objects are placed at certain points. While the hand-held eyeball perceives the virtual eye as an object (macrocosm) which is conventionally represented in the traditional perspective view, the interior is revealed as a computer-generated, iconographic collection of specifically Hungarian folk art (scenes of holy figures in bottles). A context of these representations seems relevant to me because they are in a certain sense expressions of mental (virtual) spaces in a world of concrete objects.Technical BackgroundHW: 4D-310-VGXT (SGI)SW: Artistâ€™s Proprietary
