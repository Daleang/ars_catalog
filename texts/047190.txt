Exploded Views 2.0 is an interactive installation where the visitor physically navigates through an audiovisual city landscape built up from 'point clouds'. These 'point clouds' are generated from online web 2.0 photo collections like Flickr. In Exploded Views 2.0 the audience physically moves through an interactive audio-environment and interactive imagery projected on a large screen. The movement of the observerâ€™s body sets the 3D images in motion and reveals several cityscapes from all over the world. The city landscapes are scanned with an innovative 3D scanning technology that creates a surreal and dreamlike atmosphere. These 3D scans are meticulously built-up from an enormous pool of photographs, using complex algorithms. Playing with the possibilities offered by the combination of movement and 3D interactive imagery, this installation purposefully places the viewer in a strongly absorptive experience, but what is actually offered contradicts this positioning by mediating a disconnected dreamlike experience of the city. Exploded Views 2.0 further investigates the representation of global urban environments and comments on the prominent role the World Wide Web has assumed in constructing our view of the world and ultimately, on what we perceive as reality. In contrast to the previous version of the installation, the content for 3D city landscapes is provided by users of social media platforms. The work analyses GPS tags of all the pictures available on photo-sharing community websites (such as Flickr) and reconstructs the top 400 most photographed locations into 3D. The work represents the world according to the way it is photographically represented on the web.
