'L'Autre' ('the other one') is a vir installation where the visitor is confronted with a real-time 3D animated face. The 'other one' 'lives' in a virtual space, which is connected to the real world through an interface that detects the visitor's movements. When someone enters the room he also enters the virtual space and is able to communicate.A small 'box' or interface is all that is needed to establish contact with the 'other one'. The visitor's every movement triggers interaction. The visitor becomes a 'live' joystick or mouse acting on the same virtual playing field as the numerical model. Through this interaction, a shift takes place from physical space into virtual space. The installation is not static but open and capable of development. Several visitors can take part and communicate televirtually among themselves. The meeting with the herald angel is and remains one of the most durable themes in art history. Today, this angel can even be a numerical model. A synthetic being who announces various realities to us, from artificial memories.Technical BackgroundHW: Silicon GraphicsSW: Mac Guff Ligne
