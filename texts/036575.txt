Floating Eye is an interactive installation that separates vision from the body. The participant can only see a wide-angle image floating in the air. The wide-angle image is captured by a convex mirror and a video camera. The camera is equipped with a wireless transmitter. The camera-head is attached to an airship. The participant sees the wideangle image through a wearable dome screen. The display employs a convex mirror. Light from a projector is scattered by the convex mirror. The projected image covers the participantâ€™s full field of view. This optical configuration corrects the distortion of the image taken by the camera-head. The system simulates out-of-thebody experience.The camera-head is designed to capture the image from above. The participant can see his/her body in the captured image. The airship can be maneuvered by pulling the string. Walking around, participants can see themselves as well as the surrounding scene. However, a slight wind disturbs the airship. Thus, the participant is forced to interact with the atmosphere. This installation evokes a new style of self-recognition and the relationship between humans and the atmosphere.
