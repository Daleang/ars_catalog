In its simplest form SonicWireSculptor is a novel 3-D drawing tool and a unique musical instrument, but perhaps most important—it’s just fun to play with. The project started out as a personal instrument for Pitaru to perform on. During concerts, audience members often inquired whether they could experience the tool first-hand. This encouraged Pitaru to transform the software into an immersive public installation. The installation included enhancements to the original work, allowing a wider range of users to intuitively interact with the environment.Gallery visitors would enter a dark room with a surround-sound system, a projection and a unique drawing station. Opening nights for these exhibits would often double as performance and workshop events where the audience and Pitaru explore the tool together. Participants would be encouraged to add their work to a steadily growing collection of beautiful and surprising sonic sculptures. Today, this collection includes work from professional illustrators, poets, 9-year-olds and their parents, musicians of various genres, as well as Pitaru’s own personal compositions.
