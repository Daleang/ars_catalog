The "Encyclopedia of Clamps" will set a new standard for digital media. In this second title from the team at De-Lux'O, the world of experience-oriented art is explored in CD-ROM. Using digital media to create original works of interactive art, the design team at De-Lux'O sets forth as its goal to challenge the preconceived notions of interactivity, content and technology. Utilizing a 3-D environment, the user can visit over 30 exhibition rooms that contain real works of interactive art - not corporate diluted pseudo art. Using digital media to create original work, Bill Barminski, Webster Lewin and Jerry Hesketh (De-Lux'O, Inc.) are challenging the preconceived notions of interactivity, content and technology. The interactive "Encyclopedia of Clamps" will be ideally suited for the current (boring) CD-ROM market, because not only does it offer the finest in experience-oriented art on CD-ROM, but it is also the world's first, and most complete reference guide to clamps and clamp-like devices. What could be better?Utilizing a 3-D environment as an interface, the user can visit various exhibition rooms each containing a unique art experience. The core of this program are two intersecting hallways lined with Bill Barminski's paintings through which the user can enter with a click of the mouse.
