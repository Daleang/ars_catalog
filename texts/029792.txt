ln “Interface” we consider human communication. In particular, the “Interface” concerns two persons. We think o f the “Interface” as being the space where another person can be imagined, and as the space of desire – similar in some ways to a TV or Computer screen. Absence and deficiency create the image of another person on the “Interface”. We express  the “Interface” with a resection in a mirror,  video images of a surface of water and the Japanese “Noh” mask.This work simulates the story of “Izutu”, a Japanese “Noh“ play, the traditional mask drama in Japan. “Izutu” meant a well. The story of “Izutu”: The heroine loved her husband, but he was having an affair with another woman. Although she knew of his feelings, she made no accusations against him. When her husband went out to see his lover in the night, the heroine put on his clothes and his hat to recall his image, looked down into the well and reflected her own figure on the surface of the water.Our interactive installation has a particular style. We set the narrative scene by using some objects, video images, texts, sounds and Computer. We think it is important that the audience becomes involved in our field of narration by walking around our work. And we think that not only using a sensor and a Computer, but also walking, reading, feeling and thinking in our field is interactive.Technical BackgroundHW: Macintosh, AVSW: HyperCard
