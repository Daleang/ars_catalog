Stimuline exploits the tactile dimension of sound and its transmission through the body of the listener. In a room, twenty-eight people equipped with futuristic interfaces simultaneously carry out the experiment in synthetic music diffused directly through their bodies. The device makes it possible to create and transmit remotely tactile feelings. Julien Clauss and Lynn Pook play electronic live from minimal to noise on this unique sound and touch system. By combining touch and hearing, the project tries out a new perceptive dimension on the concert and the use of the whole body as a perception interface. In the contemporary context of technically ultraconnected society, Stimuline creates “connected isolations” by materializing simultaneous intimate and group experience. The audio-tactile is based on a wearable multi-channel system, which makes the circulation of tactile and sound stimulations on the surface of the body possible. Fifteen loudspeakers without membranes are fixed directly on various parts of the body of the spectator. In this way, the mechanical vibrations resulting from the transmission of the music in the loudspeakers become perceptible on the skin and the sounds themselves are retransmitted to the inner ear by osseous conduction. The body becomes a resonance box with a spatialized diffusion. Each loudspeaker has its own channel, so that the music, and thus also the vibrations it causes, can move from one part of the body to the other. Provided with earplugs, listeners feel fine, localized vibrations which move on their skin at the same time as they hear them as if from the surface or the interior of the body. The live sounds are played on the 15-channel sound system on the body and in the room on an external 4.1-channel sound system.
