The Schmarotzer®-Model A is based on the phenomenon known as the Seebeck Effect, according to which electrical energy may be obtained through warmth differences (in this case, the body heat of the host and the warmth of the surrounding air). The Model A prototype shown here is attached to the skin of the host with adhesive tape and draws the energy needed to maintain or improve the charged state of its batteries directly from the surface of the host’s skin. The current energy state of the Model A is displayed by the variable rhythmic blinking of the integrated LED.Prototype Schmarotzer® (parasite)Model B, Version 0.3The Schmarotzer®-Model B functions according to the principle of electromagnetic induction: mechanical movement is transformed into electrical energy with a dynamo. The Model B prototype shown here is attached to the host’s knee and draws the energy needed to maintain or improve the charged state of its batteries from the movement of the host’s knee joint, for example when the host walks or rides a bicycle. The current energy state of the Model B is shown by a multistage LED charge level display.
