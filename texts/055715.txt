Humans cannot normally hear the sound of a bug’s footsteps. But Bug’s Beat transmits the amplified sound of a bug’s footsteps directly to the human auditory system through directional speakers. And by vibrating the listening chair via vibration speakers every time the bug takes a step, this device allows the observer to perceive sound as a bodily sensation.Humans visually perceive a small bug, but hear the loud sound of its footsteps and feel this sound as a vibration. There is a discrepancy between the visual information about the size of the bug and the auditory and physical perception of the noise it makes. This disorientates the observers, who may feel as if they have shrunk or as if the little bug has become gigantic.
