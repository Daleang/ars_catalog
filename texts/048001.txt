Nomadic Plants is a research project resulting from the situation of some rivers that have been contaminated by large amounts of industrial and domestic waste, which turns the water into a center of infection affecting communities and ecosystems. The project not only highlights but also seeks to analyze how we manage the waste we generate and how we can convert it into nutrients and energy in order to improve the quality of the water in rivers. This research project takes the form of a new species that operates as an antibody to keep an ecosystem in balance. It consists of an autonomous robot that lives in symbiosis with microorganisms and native plants. This species, developed to transform waste into electricity, oxygen, clean water, nutrients and life, can survive on the banks of polluted rivers. The metabolic cycle of the Nomadic Plant starts when it finds contaminated water. It sucks up the liquid and carries it to a set of microbial fuel cells. These cells accelerate the biodegradation processes to clean the water that feeds the wetlands, where plants grow along with bacteria, providing power to the electronic system. The circuits monitor and keep the ecosystem in balance, while another group of photovoltaic cells feed the robotâ€™s locomotion system. Once it has accumulated enough energy, the body wakes up and sets off in search of food. When pollution levels in the water are higher, the Nomadic Plant expresses itself through sound.
