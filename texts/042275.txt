Above the surface of upwardly sonicated silicone oil, falling droplets of the liquid are suspended by a thin membrane of air, acoustically regenerated underneath each droplet. Without coalescing for extended periods, these palpitating spheroids bounce on the air-oil interface. The repeated impact of a bouncing droplet incites a standing capillary wave that interlocks with the waves of neighboring droplets. This close-range attractive force can result in the orbital motion of droplet pairs and clusters. During more stable modes of excitation, self-organizing geometric rafts emerge in accordance with the closest packing of spheres: the distance between droplets decreases with increasing frequency, leading to dense lattice formation. The sensorial demands of processing quantum behavior incite adaptive perceptual resonances. Though brains have been compared to clocks, computers and holograms, they are “not like any artificial machine. If anything, they are like natural self-organizing processes such as stars and hurricanes.” (Mesoscopic Brain Dynamics, Freeman.) Occurring on many different scales of time and space, cascades of standing and traveling waves outline the adaptively resonating lattice of intercellular communication. These resonances can be finely tuned through a mesoscopic self-observation system like Mucilaginous Omniverse, which translates quantum harmonic pattern, phase and amplitude recognition across the cerebrospinal sea of neuromodulators.
