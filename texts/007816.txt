Our website http://www.tank-fx.com/ provides an interface similar to a common effect device. The user can upload audio material that is up to 60 seconds long. It is played immediately in a water tank, built in 1932, at the central station in Oberhausen (in the Ruhr). The surface of the tank causes an unusual reverberation which is picked up by high-quality stereo microphones. After it has been recorded, the original version and the reverberated version are mixed, as in a conventional reverberator, at a ratio set by the user in advance. The results are converted to the desired output format. They can then be downloaded and used. Tank-FX is a non-virtual reverb effect in virtual space.
