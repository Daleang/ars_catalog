The project is inspired by the overwhelming situation concerning Internet pornography. It's been reported that 12 per cent of all websites are pornographic websites. Most of them show female nudity and are targeted toward men. There are very few sites targeted toward women, and the sites that exploit men the way women are exploited are gay sites. It's obvious that the greatest part of the industry is driven by men. In addition, we receive numerous pornographic spam emails passively every day. On the web, you don't look for pornography, it looks for you. This project uses lots of Nude Men to point out this issue from a sarcastic yet hilarious perspective. You can build an animated E-card and send it to your friends with a lot of naked men (instead of naked women), and they can be programmed to appear in different postures, positions and dialogues.
