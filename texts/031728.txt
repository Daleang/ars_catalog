In the concept of the CD-ROM "Venetian Deer" (an anagram from "Die Veteranen"), the disc is no longer regarded as the real product, but rather the CD-ROM itself becomes the basis for multimedia (literally).Various media were used for the production, the most diverse media could be used for presentation. To begin with, of course, there are the different computer platforms (MAC and Win). In addition, the musical works may also be played on a normal audio CD player.But "Venetian Deer" does not work only on a personal computer. It has multiple connections to the net, which may be loaded via the Veteranen's homepage and further processed (http://www.systhema. de/veteranen). The work presented here may also be presented as an interactive live performance.Taking interactive media work out of the narrow confines of the computer screen and turning it loose to affect "real life" is part of our global concept. For this reason, the data has been prepared and treated in such a way that it may be called for all kinds of different presentation forms.A telephone book provides the observer with the possibility of calling up individual works directly and jumping to them from any position within the CD-ROM.
