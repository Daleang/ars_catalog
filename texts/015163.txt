Thirteen oscillating spheres of steel are connected to a matrix by rubber bands. A bar with a magnet at either end controls the behavior of each of the system elements. Once a sphere is connected to the bar, it is oscillated by a motor until the bar detaches and makes a new connection to another sphere. Each module has its own simple program logic and there is no main program controlling the system from the outside. No randomness or chaos needs to be simulated, because the constantly rebuilt physical structure of the sculpture becomes its own analog program for non-linear behavior. So the system produces complex behavior even though its structure and rules are simple.
