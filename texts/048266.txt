Nanohana Heels, created in collaboration with shoe designer Masaya Kushino, is a pair of shoes that plant rapeseed (Nanohana) in the soil through their mechanical heels. Using the heels, rapeseed is automatically planted as the wearer walks. Experiments by Belarusian scientists have shown that rapeseed flowers absorb radioactive substances such as caesium-137 and strontium-90 from the soil. These radionuclides are stored in the flowers’ stalks and seed coats, but not in the seeds themselves—which is fortunate, because the seeds can safely be turned into canola oil, the most popular source of biodiesel. In the 2000s this discovery led to the planting of rapeseed by the Ukraine and Belarus governments in over 50,000 hectares of Chernobyl-affected land, in a move to revive the area’s agriculture industry, which had been wiped out by the 1986 nuclear accident. In March 2011, Fukushima, Japan, also suffered a devastating nuclear power plant accident, which is hugely affecting the lives of many local residents today. Since the earthquake, there have also been movements to plant rapeseed in Fukushima, to de-contaminate the affected land. For example, the Nanohana Project Network is actively holding summits and workshops in Fukushima on the topic. The Nanohana Heels project has been developed in the hope of being a catalyst to further spread discussion on the rebuilding of Fukushima and on the future of nuclear energy.
