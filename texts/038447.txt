„Rez“, our game is an endorphin machine that releases the essence of trance through futuristic sound and visuals.„Rez“ has a code name:  K-project .  K  is derived from Wassily Kandinsky, a Russian abstract painter (1866 - 1944). Kandinsky visualized sounds as shapes in his paintings, his concept was that all sounds have their own shapes, colors and motions, We are inspired by this ideal and greatly respect him, yet we aim at a more evolving gaming expression. This is the core of „Rez“.Players shoot digital enemies to release the enemy  s frequency. These  essence sounds  are multiplied upon themselves to create  rhythm,  and  rhythm  changes the graphics of the game itself. All of this amplifies the players   groove into creating original music.By engaging in combat in „Rez“  s visually arresting environments, players will feel the ecstasy of intertwined color, form, movement and sound. The more one plays, the more the illusion surrounds and envelopes the senses, as one learns to control the music and the very shape of these worlds.Our goal is to create a sense of trance beyond that provided at clubs and parties. It is an individual journey into the soul essence of trance, transmitted by this „Rez“ device Our goal is for trance to immerse you.„Rez“ is a message that will totally go beyond existing game experiences.
