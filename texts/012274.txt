“Augmented Sculpture Series” is focused on the temporary quality of space, investigating spacetime not only as a three dimensional environment, but as space in transformation. For this purpose, two layers are produced that explore different aspects of the space-time reality. On the one hand there is the physical layer, which controls the real space and shapes the volumetric base that serves as support for the next level. The second level is a virtual, projected layer that makes it possible to control the transformation and sequentiality of space-time. The blending of both levels gives the impression of a physical geometry able to be transformed. The overlapping produces a 3D space augmented by a transformable layer that can be controlled, resulting in the capacity to alter multiple dimensions of space-time through the installation. These ideas come to life in an abstract and geometric envelope, enhanced with synesthetic audio elements and establishing a dialogue with the observer.
