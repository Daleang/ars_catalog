“Buscando al Sr. Goodbar” is a threefold tour which takes place simultaneously on Google Earth, YouTube and on an actual bus. The bus passengers embark on a physical search for the locations and authors of various YouTube videos produced in the city. Whenever any such YouTube video reveals the geographical coordinates of where it was shot, the video is tagged on Google Earth via a special software-mapping system. The bus can be followed virtually on Google Earth while YouTube videos are screened on the bus itself. In this way the audience on the bus witnesses short glimpses of what the city has to offer and start to meet some of the people living there. Somebody solves a Rubik cube in under two minutes, a young man plays the piano, a group of friends drunkenly sing together, a 14-year-old boy shows off his headbanging skills, somebody chokes his friend and causes him to pass out, somebody plays a video game, a man teaches himself Arabic, two people fall in love, a festival happens on the street.At certain points the audience leave the bus and meet some of the video authors, who present them with re-enactments of their performances. By entering the spaces where videos were produced, an intimate encounter occurs between video makers and audience.
