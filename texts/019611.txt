In 2008 London Fieldworks created “Super Kingdom”, an installation of animal “show homes” modeled on the authoritarian architecture of dictators’ palaces set within the ancient woodland of King’s Wood, Kent, England. In 2009 the artists re-purposed their forest-based installation as a film set for a digital moving image work: “Monarchy”.“Super Kingdom” can be viewed as a social engineering experiment for animals—a new community in the making referencing despots’ palaces, gated community developments such as Alphaville in Brazil and the fortified exclusivity afforded to the wealthy and super-rich—all designed to keep urban reality at bay.The title, “Super Kingdom”, is a reference to both the utopian imaginary and biological taxonomic hierarchy. The project reflects both human and animal hierarchy as territorial relationship to landscape; it is informed by changing habitat, the displacement of animals as a consequence of urban development and conservationist strategy, and global concerns about fluid populations and porous borders. The project was initially inspired by reports of anomalous animal behavior in the natural world as a response to shifting environmental cues, and the controversial conservationist practices of re-wilding and assisted migration where animals are strategically re-located—redolent of human social engineering projects. The project also drew on the artists’ experiences of edge cities or self sufficient off-worlds and the collision of habitats and inequality that exist around them and resulted in the series of “Super Kingdom” structures referencing the off-worlds, the architecture of fear (as Tunde Agbola describes fortified lifestyles in Lagos), and the architecture of dictators’ palaces. The score for “Monarchy”, by their long-term collaborator Dugal McKinnon, contributes to the sense of dislocation through shifts in what sonically seems to fit or not fit with what is seen. Mixing naturalistic sounds of flora, fauna and weather—recorded in New Zealand woodlands—with industrial noise results in a terrifying soundtrack for the English countryside, which serves to challenge our presumptions of the safety and longevity of the woodland environment.
