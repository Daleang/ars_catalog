Casa Jasmina is a two-year pilot project in the field of domestic electronic networking, or “the Internet of Things in the Home.” The aim is to integrate traditional Italian skills in furniture and interior design with emergent skills in open-source electronics. The project is a showplace inside a large industrial building already shared by Toolbox Co-Working, Fablab Torino, and Officine Arduino.Casa Jasmina has three main functions:- A real-world test bed for hacks, experiments, innovative IoT, and digital fabrication projects.- A curated space for public exposure of excellent artifacts and best practices.- A guesthouse for occasional visitors to Toolbox, Officine Arduino, and Fablab Torino.Casa Jasmina was founded in order to encourage:- Makers, designers, digital artists, IoT experts, students, and universities to research, experiment, and use new technologies and new production methods related to open source and IoT.- Factories, industries, corporate companies, and start-ups to be interested in IoT and to try to overcome the boundary between classical and open source production. Industries that will create tomorrow’s living spaces.- Ordinary people interested in testing the IoT in everyday life in the house of the future.Although it resembles an apartment home, Casa Jasmina is actually a combination of lab, gallery space, and B&B, so it needs dynamic management. Casa Jasmina is not merely a kitchen, library, bedroom, and bathroom. It’s a public interface for a larger Internet-of-Things process of building things, acquiring and installing things, removing things, repairing and maintaining things, storing things, recording and linking to things, and, last but not least, getting rid of things. Casa Jasmina is an incubator, and its purpose is industry-boosting in the Torino and Piemonte IoT space. The successors of the Casa Jasmina project will be real homes with real, innovative products inside.
