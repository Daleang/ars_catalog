POD (Wind Array Cascade Machine) is the first installation created for the Wind Array Cascade Machine (WACM) data network. POD is a 64-channel installation that uses 2880 light emitting diodes (LEDs) to portray a 4-dimensional picture of the wind. Each of the 64 “pods” functions as a velocity amplitude meter of the 64 wind sensors of the WACM data network. POD is designed to operate from either live streamed data from the installed WACM system in Montreal, or from recorded wind data previously generated by the WACM system. POD was most recently exhibited at Gallery Oboro, Montréal, directly after its European premiere at the Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma, Helsinki, Finland, for ISEA 2004.Wind Array Cascade Machine (WACM) is a 64-channel environmental mapping and data network diffusion system. Using the wind that blows across an open field or rooftop, WACM’s 64 motion sensors track the velocity amplitude and wave patterns of the wind in real time. Direction of the wave movement of the wind is captured in the complete network data set. The captured wave patterns of the wind metaphorically represent the movement of sound (sine) waves. The data generated by the WACM can be recorded and archived for later use, and can be streamed over the WWW for use in any Heimbecker installation requiring the WACM data set.Since August 2004, WACM has been located on the rooftop of the Ex-Centris building in Montreal, with the support of the Daniel Langlois Foundation. The electronic and software systems for both POD and WACM were designed in collaboration with Avatar, Québec (Canada).
