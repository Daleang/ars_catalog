Aerocene is a multi-disciplinary project that proposes a new epoch. In the wake of the debates on the Anthropocene, the project foregrounds the artistic and scientific exploration of environmental issues, and promotes common links between social, mental, and physical ecologies. A synthesis of art, technology, and environmental awareness, Aerocene embodies a vision for fuel- and emissions-free travelling and living in the atmosphere.Developed by the Aerocene Foundation, Aerocene manifests in the testing and development of solar sculptures that float without any need of fuel or gas, just capturing the heat of the sun and the infrared radiation of the earth’s surface.The Aerocene Foundation–initiated by artist Tomás Saraceno–is a non-profit organisation devoted to community building, scientific research, artistic experience, and education. The Foundation works with artists, thinkers, scientists, researchers, balloonists, technologists, humanitarian workers, influencers, and visionaries to increase public awareness of global resource circulation, and reactivate a common imaginary towards new symbiotic relationships with the earth.
