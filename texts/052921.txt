Designed to build a more nuanced location-specific overview of the cityscapeas experienced by people with vision loss who interact with it on a regular basisBlindWiki collects experiences and opinions in order to produce a collaborative map of the unseen.The app allows participants to record site-specific audio and to publish it to the BlindWiki platform. Users have the opportunity to walk through their city with smartphones, receiving data that participants have previously tagged. The app triggers geo-located stories and tagged obstacles. The app not only allows participants to share their findings, but it also raises social awareness on the diverse perception of the visually impaired.
