Crowdcrafting is a crowdsourcing, citizen science or microtasking platform developed by Scifabric and powered by PYBOSSAï‚¾our open source technology, where researchers or citizens can create a research project in a matter of minutes without having to develop a single line of code, since we provide the templates and tools that will help them kick start a project in minutes, replicating the scientific method. Crowdcrafting was born at a hackathon in Cape Town, South Africa in 2011. In partnership with our key collaborators, such as CERN, United Nations (UNITAR), and the University of Geneva, we have reached out to and inspired many people to get involved in research.
