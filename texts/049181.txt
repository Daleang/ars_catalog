In this theatrical re-enactment of one of the most important formats of contemporary political and scientific discourse, the 650 audience members are invited to represent the 196 delegations of the original “conferences of the parties.” Three or four spectators form a (randomly gathered) delegation and during the three-hour-performance are asked to make a decision for the country they represent about the level of CO2-reduction and a financial contribution to the Green Climate Fund. In the end of the performance, the obligations and contributions gathered are presented and evaluated live in the theater. Eighteen real and well-known climate researchers, politicians, businessmen and representatives of NGOs lead the spectator-delegations through the diverse topics of climate conferences. The 650 “delegates” are split into groups of 60 people, they move through different scenarios and briefings, which prepare them to act as delegates of the 196 nations. Taking on the position of a country and a region that is very different from their own, the audience experiences a shift of perspective. The talks, briefings and negotiations the spectator-delegates are involved in create a dynamic exchange with the experts and between themselves—together they are all performers in this theatrical world climate conference. The performance is linked to events in the “real world” via Skype, experts from the real world conferences in Lima, and this year in Paris, communicate with the people in the theater and create a complex interactive and multimedia performance.
