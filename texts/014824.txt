“Malamp”, a trans-disciplinary project, began in 2006, when New York artist Brandon Ballengée was commissioned by The Arts Catalyst to conduct biological field-research into the health of British amphibians. Within a week, the artist began finding dozens of unusual English toads at a site in Yorkshire, England. Following these initial surveys, several sites have been found with deformed frogs, toads, and newts. Working in scientific collaboration with Richard Sunter, these findings are the first description of high occurrences of amphibian malformation at sites in England. The art and science research team is still investigating the possible causes. In what he calls “Eco-actions”, the artist invites the public to participate in the scientific fieldresearch. “As an artist and activist, I believe the first step to environmental and social change is interaction. By participating as a biologist and inviting the public, I confront people with the ecology of their backyard. Sometimes we find healthy species in functioning wetlands. Other times the investigations uncover the effects of degradation. Like the site in England, on the surface a scenic residential garden pond, a fabricated vision of tranquility, yet containing monstrous environmentally sculpted creatures. The experience is emotionally complex, often uncanny, and hopefully changes people. These dual art and biology projects are my attempt at sculpting society.”
