The Light Barrier series of artworks create a semi-material mode of existence, materializing objects from light. The name refers to the light barrier in relativistic physics, which delineates between that which is material and that which is light. Light Barrier Third Edition is a new installment in this series of works, expressing the confusion and nonconformities at the boundaries between materials and non-materials, reality and illusion, and existence and absence, whilst crafting a surreal vision which twists the human instinct of time and space. It is a direct approach to the artists’ theme of ‘drawing in the air’. In this edition, 8 architectural video projectors are split into 630 sub-projectors using a structure of concave mirrors designed by artificial nature. Each mirror is uniquely shaped and collaborates together to make a single image in the air. By accurately calibrating hundreds of projectors, light beams can be merged in the haze to draw in the air. The third edition of Light Barrier was commissioned by the Asia Culture Center in Gwangju.
