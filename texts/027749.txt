The installation 'Telematic Dreaming', which ran from May to September in the 'Koti' exhibition at the Kajaani Gallery in Finland, deals with the concept of ecstasy as coined by Jean Baudrillard in his essay 'The Ecstasy of Communication', about optical and acoustic communication across data links. In 'Telematic Dreaming', two double beds some distance apart are connected by video linkup. The artist lies on a blue-colored bed which is monitored by a video camera suspended directly above. A chroma-key video mixing device hides the blue and substitutes a background of grass, water or other images from a VHS videotape, giving the illusion that the artist is in different surroundings. This video image is relayed to the gallery where it is projected onto the white bed. Here, a second camera sends another image back to the artist so that he can watch - and interact with - visitors approaching the bed onto which his own life-size image is being projected. This two-way linkup is completed by a, microphone and loudspeaker contained in the pillows of each bed, allowing a telephone-like conversation between the artist and visitor. The figure on the bed gestures to visitors to come closer, sit on the bed, and discuss the images. The video tape is as varied, ambiguous, surreal, and as much like virtual reality as I believe my dreams to be.Technical BackgroundHW/SW: Teleconferencing
