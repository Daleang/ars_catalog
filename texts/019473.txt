“Bare” is a skin-safe conductive ink invented by four designers’ intent on creating a new space between wearable technologies and electronic implants by applying electronic circuitry directly to the skin. A thorough study of the history of body art and ornamentation led to the creation of an ink that humanizes wearable technologies and provides a sensuous method of applying electronics to the body through customized circuitry. Temporary, non-toxic and water-soluble, “Bare” is composed of conductive particles suspended in materials that are commonly found in food and cosmetic products. This combination is the result of extensive research into a wide array of inert and non-toxic ingredients allowing for the safe application directly on the skin. The design-led development process behind “Bare” generated over 120 different material samples before reaching the final formula. “Bare” has the consistency of paint and can be applied with a brush, stamp or spray. The ink is currently best suited to low power, information-lean applications such as switching and simple data transfer. The ink has the potential to replace and augment existing technologies where wires are cumbersome or undesirable. “Bare Conductive” seamlessly connects traditional forms of body ornamentation with contemporary wearable electronics, humanizing wearable technologies, and providing an elegant alternative for the application of electronics to the body via customized circuitry. “Bare” is currently being developed for use in medical devices, stand alone products, rapid prototyping and larger-scale applications in the built environment.
