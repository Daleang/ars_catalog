The Robot World Cup Initiative (RoboCup) is an inter national research and education initiative. It is an attempt to foster AI and intelligent robotics research by providing a standard problem where wide range of technologies can be integrated and examined, as well as being used for integrated project-oriented education.For this purpose, RoboCup chose to use soccer game as a primary domain, and organizes RoboCupiThe Robot World Cup Soccer Games and Conferences. In order for a robot team to actually perform a soccer game, various technologies must be incorporated, including: design principles of autonomous agents, multi-agent collaboration, strategy acquisition, real-time reasoning, robotics, and sensor-fusion. RoboCup is a task for a team of multiple fast-moving robots under a dynamic environment. RoboCup also offers a software platform for research on the software of RoboCup.While soccer game is used as a standard problem where broad-range of efforts will be concentrated and integrated, competition is only a part of RoboCup acitivity.Current activity of the RoboCup Initiative consists of technical conferences, Robot World Cup, RoboCup Challenge programs, education programs and infra structure development.Nevertheless, Robot World Cup competition is the central pillar of our activity, where researchers can get together and evaluate the research progress. Currently, RoboCup has: Simulator League, Small Roboter League, Full Set Small Robot League, which is 11 robots per team, Middle Size Robot League, Sony Legged Robot League (sponsored by Sony), Humanoid League (from 2002),TeleOperation Track, RoboCup Commentator Exhibition.
