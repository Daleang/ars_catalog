I have created a language to delete, to compact mental texts and graphics, to eliminate unwanted thoughts and make them personal hieroglyphics. The performer is seated in front of the audience and simply starts writing on a laptop connected to a screen and stops when he or she cannot think/delete/write any more. The writing must be accompanied by an excessive and incoherent talkativeness. The performer invites the audience to participate and to delete/compact/maintain their own thoughts, keeping up an excessive and uncontrollable flow of words.To create a language to delete: delete the language between humans and/or machines, hard drives, the memories, the alphabetic convention, textual noise, the “junk” operating systems, the satellite data, the identity online, the identity offline, the algorithmic remains on the hard drives that do not disappear under the hammer. A language to delete what is not possible to delete. To generate a new alphabet, combine it and say it thinking all the time of erasing what is being said, the possibility of a language as black hole. Thinking and erasing in one action that does not generate remains … or alphabets.
