“The Computer is a tool for absolute perfection in any area. Its capacities in visual matters are not limited to that kind of aesthetics we have seen once too often, the smoothness, the glitter, the reflection and those fast camera moves. My works, both in the animation and the installation and sound areas, deal with the development of new approaches, include the insertion of reality. This does not mean an imitation of reality, but the insertion of the latter, for things that already exist need not be reinvented by me as an artist on the computer.THE DIGITAL NEWSCASTERJust as the electronic picture is divided into 25 frames per second in order to appear homogeneous, each letter that the newscaster says stands for one picture.THE VISUALIZED ALPHABETA well-known newscaster pronounces the alphabet in a way that one picture per letter can be digitized. At the same time, the sound is recorded accordingly and classed with the picture. Now it's possible to let the pictures run according to the next input.IN DEN MUND GELEGT This alphabet, the pictures, the sounds, are available to a number of people for manipulation. The interactive element takes its course. Any text that is typed in with the computer's keyboard will be announced by the newscaster. The news manipulate the newscaster.THEY BECOME TRUE!” (Christine Meierhofer)Technical background:In den Mund gelegt – The Media is not the message, Interaktive Video-Klang-Installation, 1991HW: Laserdiscplayer, Mac II FX, Hypercard-Programm
