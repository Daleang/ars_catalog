Six-Forty by Four-Eighty is a multidisciplinary, interactive lighting installation composed of magnetic, physical pixels, stainless steel and remote controllers. The pixels change color in response to touch and communicate with each other using the human body as a conduit for digital information. The pixels can be reconfigured in space and animated in time to customize our luminous environment. By transposing the pixel from the confines of the screen and into the physical world, focus is drawn to the materiality of computation and new forms for design emerge.
