In the installation “Chapter I: The Discovery” the visitor discovers a sci-fi geometric object that outputs a code of light and sounds. This work questions the viewer’s perception about the truthfulness of what is shown, outlining a journey from the initial viewing of a series of videos with synthetic images and ending up in an encounter with a physical interactive object that co-opts information flows, sound and light transmission. Rather than answering essential philosophical questions—such as: How can technological advances be controlled? On what ethical bases can its purposes be chosen? Who is entitled to decide on the ultimate mission of machines? Can machines destroy us?—this installation is about reformulating these modern philosophical questions through the use of images associated with the popular culture of science fiction. The sculpture responds to presence, demonstrating a will to communicate. The resulting interaction and behavior are an imitation of artificial intelligence. They are expressed as extremely simple rules capable of generating apparently complex behavior. But, how intelligent is it? Is it a tool for communication? How autonomous is it? Is it alive? Does it exist? Accordingly, the installation renews an age-old cultural groundbase, questioning the limits of our notions of artificial intelligence and cutting across our collective imaginary of science fiction.
