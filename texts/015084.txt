The interactive installation “Double-Taker (Snout)” deals in a whimsical manner with the themes of trans-species eye contact, gestural choreography, subjecthood and autonomous surveillance. The project consists of an eight-foot-long (2.5m) industrial robot arm, costumed to resemble an enormous inchworm or elephant’s trunk, which responds in unexpected ways to the presence and movements of people in its vicinity. Sited on a low roof above a museum entrance and governed by a real-time machine-vision algorithm, “Double-Taker (Snout)”  orients a supersized googly-eye towards passers-by, tracking their bodies and suggesting an intelligent awareness of their activities. The goal of this kinetic system is to perform convincing “double-takes” at its visitors, in which the sculpture appears to be continually surprised by the presence of its own viewers—communicating, without words, that there is something uniquely surprising about each of us.
