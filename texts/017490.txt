“Hand From Above” encourages us to question our normal routine when we often find ourselves rushing from one destination to another. Inspired by “Land of the Giants” and Goliath, we are reminded of mythical stories by mischievously unleashing a giant hand from the BBC Big Screen.Passers by will be playfully transformed. What if humans weren’t on top of the food chain?Unsuspecting pedestrians will be randomly tickled, stretched, flicked or removed entirely in real time by a giant deity. Actions change depending on how crowded the scene is or on weather conditions.“Hand From Above” was created using openFrameworks.
