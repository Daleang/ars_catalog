“Pollstream” is a collection of ideas, forms and images that explore man-made clouds. Our fascination with these clouds stems from their physical properties: their perpetual movement and their undefined form, but also for their potential as a carrier of political ideas. Across a number of projects (both realized and unrealized), clouds are used as a visual metaphor to aestheticize emissions and chemical toxins. From 2002 to 2008, “Pollstream” has been developed in collaboration with a multitude of partners from the fields of laser physics, computer science, electronic engineering, an industrial energy producer, an air-quality monitoring organization, museums, art festivals and galleries, environmental activists and a governmental energy- awareness agency. At the end of February 2008, the main objective of the project was completed, with the installation “Nuage Vert” in Helsinki. The realization of this project, after five years of negotiations, mediation and public discussion, underlines the idea of making art on a citywide scale, engaging the city hall, the energy industry and the city’s inhabitants, precisely at the moment of cultural change. Nuage Vert, 2008“Nuage Vert” is an environmental artwork realized in Helsinki, which illuminates the vapor emitted by an energy power plant and responds to local energy consumption.Champs d’Ozone, 2007“Champs d’Ozone” is a chromatic cloud work, commissioned by the Centre Pompidou, Paris, for the exhibition “Airs de Paris”. Installed in the sixth floor of the center, a synthetic cloud floats in the Paris skies, reacting to toxin measurements from local air monitoring stations. Toy Emissions(My friends all drive Porsches), 2007“Toy Emissions” is a video performance, with a miniature radio-controlled Porsche Cayenne, coloring the air of New York City. Smoking Lamp, 2006“Smoking Lamp” is a lamp that reacts to cigarette smoke, which coincided with the pan-European ban on smoking in public places.
