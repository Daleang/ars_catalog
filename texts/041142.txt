Sensitive to Pleasure is a conflicting work, an intimate piece in which I emphasize the controversial relationship with my own work in front of the public over time. I’m standing still outside the door of a dark ambisonic cube; I let in only one visitor at a time. Inside the ambisonic cube there is my work, a naked human female (which I call the creature), which is capable of revealing the sound of her body when in contact with other human beings. The physical interaction between the creature and the visitor is played back into my body through electrical pulses, provoking a strong physical experience in me, which is recognized as painful but which might be also pleasant. I use the visitor to gain a physical experience from my work.The intimacy between the visitor and the creature inside the ambisonic cube will not be documented, so as to give the visitor the possibility of fully experiencing it through involvement and exposure. I’m interested in exploring the way visitors may interact with the creature knowing that their behavior is provoking a strong physical reaction in my body outside; at same time I’m exploring the idea of the public being in a voyeuristic situation looking at me experiencing the piece. A restricted path of lights on the floor guides the visitor to the entrance to the ambisonic cube; the subtle changes the lights reflect the encounters between the visitor and the creature, enhancing the sensuality of the piece, as well as implying one’s own perceptions of my physical experience on stage. With a homage to Pygmalion (Ovid's Metamorphoses, X), the sculptor who falls in love with a statue he has made, this piece deals with an inverted relationship of control between the creator and his own creation.
