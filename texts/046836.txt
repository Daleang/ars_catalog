Our mission is to create an innovation in the communications area.When we look at Japan and its people we see that many are very shy and have trouble expressing their basic feelings to others. We decided to invent a new communication tool for them using their brain waves. Brain waves refer to the change in potential when the human brain is active, and they express moods such as “focused” and “relaxed” states. They have recently been the center of attention as a method of clarifying the human mind and gaining insight into what people are thinking.We have created a new augmented human organ that utilizes brainwaves for a new way of communication. This is the necomimi—short for “neuro-communication machine.”Since there was a need to attach the brainwave sensor to the forehead, we used the cat’s ears motif frequently used in Japanese manga and fashion items to make it fun for everyone to wear.By visualizing the brain activities, we will be able to see people’s various characteristics. This also means that users will be able to express their emotions straight from the brain, and it enables users to communicate with anyone, regardless of language, age, gender and race.When the user is “focused” the ears will stand up, and when the user is “relaxed” the ears lie down. If the user is simultaneously “focused” and “relaxed,” as seen with many professional athletes, the ears move rapidly.At first, expressing one’s emotions directly by necomimi may be a strange experience. But after a few minutes people could control the ears easily. It was a moment when we acquired a new, augmented human organ. After all, necomimi has greatly helped the Japanese to communicate with each other better and has been an enormous hit.
