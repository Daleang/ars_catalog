Environment Dress is a smart dress that measures the aggressiveness of the environment to analyze how it affects people’s mood and behavior. The natural sensors of our body are not able to alert us to external environmental factors. However, through the use of technology, we can know how these factors affect us and anticipate them.Environment Dress is a wearable equipped with sensors that analyze issues such as variations in noise, temperature, atmospheric pressure, ultraviolet radiation, or the amount of carbon monoxide present in our daily lives. All of this geo-located information is connected to the user’s mood via an app. In this way, thanks to so-called "machine learning", the garment is able to learn and anticipate the emotions of its user, linking specific environmental conditions with our previously recorded emotions. Environment Dress is a project created in open code.
