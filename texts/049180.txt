The PSX Consultancy project conceives augmentations for vegetal species to enhance the given client’s natural reproductive processes. In other words, we make sex toys for plants.Misleadingly quirky, the PSX Consultancy is a project investigating the changing paradigm of the human/non-human relationship. Incorporating cultural frameworks through which we as humans understand ourselves and our environment—science, design and art—we improvise design tools that challenge our anthropocentric vantage point to think on the plants’ behalf. The concepts produced by the interdisciplinary team of designers, artists and scientists are science-based, design-driven, irony-infused and playfully delivered. As the plant clients are silent about their necessities, we have relied on scientific knowledge of plant biology as well as design methodologies in the pursuit of thought-provoking, intelligible augmentations. What happens when artistic motivation appropriates human-centered design for use on plant clients? The result of the interdisciplinary approach is critically discursive objects posing as sex toys, inherently paradoxical and absurd, yet manifesting our “all means possible” attempt to truly understand the non-human. Through the hybrid exploration of the parallelism between plant and human reproductive strategies, we uncover the realm of bio-logic whilst provoking the ethical discourse connected to post-anthropocentrism. The motivation, client biology/requirements and bio-logic of the particular “sex toys” is explained in the attached booklet.The installation of 3D-printed proposals alongside the plant clients is only one of the outcomes of this process-based project. Equally important is the hands-on engagement of the public in the form of workshops and discussions across different cultural traditions, leading to an ever-expanding collection of plants and their sex toys while inviting the audience to explore the non-human experiences in their mind.
