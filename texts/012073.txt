“Appeel” is a virus spreading through interacting individuals. Surfaces are covered by thousands of colored stickers laid out in a grid. Peeling a sticker off leaves a white spot in the grid, hence people start individually and collectively changing its appearance. Once off the wall, the stickers ask to be stuck somewhere: people begin putting them on objects, walls, people; they collect them, they compose new images, they write messages. Slowly, the little stickers spread, appearing further away from their source and occupying space. People’s playful interactions through “Appeel” depend on basic principles of interactivity and generativity applied to purely analogous means. (The dot spreads with the potential to ironically mark its carrier as a symbol of sale and occupation.) Its immanent potential to penetrate regulated structures of public and private space adds a subversive undertone to its apparent plainness.
