Perfume Global Site Project commemorates the global debut of the techno-pop group Perfume. Based on the concept of fans and creators launching the group into the world together, this massive project involved the planning and production of a teaser site, an open-source project and live performances by the members of Perfume. Following the site launch, the open-source project provided free distribution of original music and choreographic motion-capture data from the official website. Secondary creation by programmers was enabled by providing sample codes and extended features for the use of data via the social coding service GitHub. This gave birth to over 600 richly varied projects in countries around the world and six million total views of all films. On Perfumeâ€™s global tour, works developed through this project were introduced and they performed compositions and choreography distributed through the site.
