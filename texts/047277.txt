In 2012, Northern Lights.mn commissioned me to build 1,000 custom bike lights to distribute to cyclists attending an outdoor arts festival in Minneapolis, MN. Using radio transceivers and insights gained from complex systems research, these devices synchronized their blinking patterns with other nearby devices, altering social rules of proximity and generating a citywide self-organizing system.
