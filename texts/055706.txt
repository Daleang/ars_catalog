Inspired by the story Ugly the Cat found on a website featuring wisdom quotes and sad stories, Ugly is a broken simulated short film about a Native American chief and an ugly cat trying to find peace in an evil neighborhood.Animation in Ugly is a combination of puppeteering and dynamic computer simulation and varies between physically accurate and broken. The Ugly characters are ragdolls built from connected dynamic body parts, which can collide with the environment. Like a marionette, the character is connected via simulated strings to animated controllers.Animating like this feels like real-life filmmakingâ€“the animator sets the direction and the simulated characters interpret the action similarly to real actors.The process relies on experimentation and the results are unpredictable and prone to errors, which is difficult to deal with when trying to animate a specific movement. At the same time, the loss of control is liberating and the outcome is spontaneous and always unique.
