Balance is delicate, and sometimes we fall down. A 170-year-old sofa balances precariously on one leg, constantly teetering, responding internally to external forces.Relationships are balancing acts, and delicate ones at that. This idea turned into a balancing sofa as I was thinking about how all our social interactions can be found on these humble pieces of furniture: dinner, chatting, sex, job interviews, even death. Is it surprising that we construct such a solid footing to support the delicate dance of relationships, so prone to losing their rhythm and falling down? These ideas of foundation and fragility seemed so distinct and yet inseparable that I became interested in trying to illuminate it a bit. The result emerged as something both sincere and absurd.This sculpture is a sofa, stood semi-upright, which balances on one leg, via an internal robotic mechanism. A low groan, the volume below that of normal speech, is emitted intermittently by the motors as the piece struggles to remain upright. There is a box on the floor enclosing batteries and controls, connected via a flexible steel cable conduit.The project had two unique technical and artistic goals. The primary one was to create a kinetic metaphor for the inherent risk in social relations, which was authentic, rather than illusory. Secondarily, I was interested in whether an object could actually be balanced perpetually on a fixed point.The internal mechanism of the sculpture is based on a concept known as a reaction wheel, a technology most often deployed in satellites to correct spatial orientation. Rather than shift its center of mass in reaction to falling, or employ gyroscopic forces, freely spinning motors apply torque to the frame of the sofa, causing it in turn to attempt to rotate in the opposite direction, effecting a weight shift about its foot on the ground.
