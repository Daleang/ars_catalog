“The Kinetic Sculpture” is a metaphorical translation of the process of form-finding in art and design. 714 metal spheres hanging from thin steel wires attached to individually controlled stepper motors and covering the area of six square meters animate a seven-minute-long mechatronic narrative. In the beginning moving chaotically, then evolving to several competing forms that eventually resolve into the finished object, the kinetic sculpture creates an artistic visualization of the process of form-finding in different variations.
