Usually people want to see movies on big screens. We’re challenging this preconceived notion with 3D visuals you can view in the palm of your hand. 3D visuals unfold in a tiny space like a moving miniature model, offering the chance to see something new, and creating a sense of intimacy. Discovering universes within ever tinier spaces is something that perhaps reflects Japanese sensibilities.You simply snap the cover onto a small visual device like the iPhone or iPodTouch. The design is simple and uses inexpensive materials. Of course, you don’t need special 3D glasses. Enjoy 3D visuals, any place, any time. Moreover, “i3DG” creates an extremely private theater, leading to an experience that is completely different from watching movies on a big screen surrounded by lots of people. Also, content creation and presentation don’t require any special skills or technology (such as simultaneous filming with two cameras, or CG production techniques). The visuals are 2D images, simply divided into three sections – back, middle and front. This method for 3D production particularly suits hand-drawn art animation, because it doesn’t require splitting the image into two points of view. Cost performance is excellent, and it’s easy to use for visual creators. There is plenty of potential for future development.
