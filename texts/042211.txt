The Tropospheric Laboratory is a huge and highly confusing data and image generator—allowing insights into cloud cores (aerosols) and othermatter of the apogee. The installation obscures the borders of the possible and the impossible within the realm of aerosols, invisible due to their nano scale, but omnipresent to any human environment. It is a metaphor machine centered around a real cloud.The laboratory is the gravimetric document of Cloud Core Scanner—an experiment and artistic project in weightlessness by Agnes Meyer-Brandis,carried out on board a German Aerospace Center research plane. It reflects an iridescent world, between controlled and unleashed states: artisticresearch on the quest for a degree of reality within constructions.
