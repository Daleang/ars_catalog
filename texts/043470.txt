Agnes Meyer-Brandis’s poetic-scientific investigations weave fact, imagination, storytelling and myth, past, present and future. In the project Moon Goose Analogue: Lunar Migration Bird Facility she develops an ongoing narrative based on The Man in the Moone, by Bishop Francis Godwin, in which the protagonist flies to the moon in a chariot towed by “moon geese”. Meyer-Brandis has actualized this concept by raising eleven moon geese, giving them astronauts’ names,* imprinting them on herself as goose-mother, training them to fly and taking them on expeditions and housing them in a remote moon-analog habitat. An analog is a rehearsal for living in space. At various remote facilities around the world astronauts are practicing for the psychological challenges humans can face living away from earth. Meyer-Brandis’s remote analog habitat simulates the conditions of the moon and will be accessed and operated from Meyer-Brandis’s control room installation within the gallery, where instructional videos, photographs and showcases of the goose eggshells and footprints will be displayed. The viewer can see and interact with the geese here in the control room in real time while the artist encourages you to explore the margins of reality, in that liminal space where scientific data becomes elegiac data. Meyer-Brandis develops the contested history of Godwin’s original fiction— posthumously and pseudonymously published in 1603 as the supposedly genuine account of the travels of Domingo Gonsales. She weaves a narrative that explores the observer’s understanding of the fictitious and the factual, with a nod to notions of the believably absurd. Neil, Svetlana, Gonzales, Valentina, Friede, Juri, Buzz, Kaguya-Anousheh, Irena, Rakesh, Konstantin-Hermann
