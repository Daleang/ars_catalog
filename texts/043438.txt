This bi-national project is about a delicate game with an uncommon dynamic. Two players win or two players lose a game with only one way of winning: to collaborate and balance with your opponent. During a month-long residency at the University of Texas at El Paso, the artist filmed scores of border residents as they played a game of cooperation by balancing a specially designed carpenter’s spirit-level between them. The delicacy and difficulty of this task, and the goodwill and cooperation of the players, reflected the delicate balance of life on the border. During the four-month exhibition of the piece at the Rubin Center, gallery visitors played the same game using a different level, with an electronic device attached that detected balance and logged the face-to-face play time onto a data base and converted it to meters of cooperation. The goal of participation was to exceed the length of the US-Mexico border (3,169,000m). The final score at the gallery was 70,865 meters. Afterwards, the project continued with a website application to keep up the goal of overtaking the length of the border. The website application adds meters under the following rules: 1) the time in the site accumulates meters, 2) sharing duplicates the meters accumulated during the visit, and 3) the number of simultaneously connected people accelerates the account in an exponential way. The website’s content is an open documentation based on an online video of 10:24 min., which can be modified by publishing overlapping and synchronous opinions to the video. On March 16, 2011, people were summoned to an online meeting to achieve the initial goal of the game installed in the gallery. Over four hours, around 1,500 people raised the score to 15 million meters, over four times the length of the Mexico-US border, constructing a gesture in community to support the balance and the possibility of collaboration between two cities, countries or points of view.
