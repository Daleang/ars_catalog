The experimental music video for Floating Points (the name under which English musician and neuroscientist Sam Shepherd performs), portrays an abstract oscillating light that evolves through the music in different life forms. All lights are in-camera produced effects that are made by a self-developed light paint machine. We’ve created a piece that, both in content and in its implementation, speaks of an analogue universe. Technique and form merge to bring out the geometry of Floating Points’ sound, which, as a living being, mutates and creates a particular ecosystem. We invented a light-painting machine capable of reproducing light forms in motion, allowing us to film it with a camera, without the need of postproduction. The machine was also capable of controlling other aspects such as camera shutter release, lights and fog machines, and a self-built motion control system. We wanted to make a video that involved a technical challenge and allowed us to conceptually explore the artistic complexity of Floating Points' sound, so we could reflect its music in a visual way.It took us 6 months of work divided between development and shooting (outdoors and indoors).
