“We are all puppets, and our best hope for even partial liberation is to try to decipher the logic of the puppeteer.” Robert Wright, “The Moral Animal”, 1994 The “Jammer Horn” is the inversion of the horn’s functionality yet relates to its principles. A temperature sensor triggers a long-range cellphone jammer that sits inside the horn. Using the horn’s bell, a directional signal is sent out blocking any cell-phone activity within 30-50 meters. The blower of the horn achieves supremacy over communication within the immediate vicinity. The horn has been in existence throughout the world for millennia. Traditionally it was used in rituals and ceremonies. Its role was for communication between humans and mediation between gods and humans, it’s message being translated into sound signals. These could be transmitted over long distances in a much more directional way than the human voice. The message was of orders, warnings or prophecy. Thus the horn became an integral part of mythology and religion.
