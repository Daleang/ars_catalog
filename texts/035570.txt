Our research and development work is based on the assumption that the technical standards of our information society include multi-media computers and broad bandwidth in communication.The Web dramaturgy which is in the foreground of the Binary Art Site of Zeitgenossen is the result of a radical,futur eoriented concept of information architecture. As a consequence the whole navigation is reduced to one dragable moving star,which is to turn off and on.Within this meta-concept we create a three-star program: Imagination (offering space for our art projects which are specially developed for the Web),Inspir ation (presenting theoretical and artistic positions on media structures) and Information (devoted to quantum communication; to be launched in the fall of 2000).Within the blue dots you will find more basic information.The whole site is programmed in FlashArt is what we consider one of the last bastions of unfettered imaginationâ€”what we believe to be the basis of elementary processes of change. Considerations are primarily concentrated on the loaded field marked by the modern information society in its relationto individual views of the world.
