The theme of our work is sculpture made by sound. The method of this work is a white liquid jumping up and down on a speaker. This liquid is potato starch dissolved in water. A dilantancy phenomenon is observable when the potato starch is mixed with equal amounts of water. When stimulated, the dissolved starch becomes solid, yet returns to liquid when the stimulation ceases. It is this phenomenon that we use in our work.Many different shapes can be observed as a result of stimulation of the starch. This piece has two modes of excitation: one is by applying a constant sound frequency; the second is by using the changing frequencies of the viewer’s brainwaves, especially interactive when using alpha and beta waves. In some ways, our work is influenced by the idea of brainwave modulation in Tarkovski’s Solaris. The viewer can see the changes shaped by his or her own brainwaves. Furthermore, touching the sculpture can be part of the interaction. This is a new way to experience one’s own brainwaves.
