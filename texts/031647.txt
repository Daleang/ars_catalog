A project by Alexei Shulgin in which he proposes a new form of art: "Form Art".This new art form is based on the Internet technology and provides artists with new possibilities for self-expression. The Web site devoted to "Form Art" consists of numerous Form Art images and animations, as well as other examples of Form Art implementations. The site is open for contribution and discussion and will hopefully become an international center for development and research of this form of art.The project has been realised at C3, Budapest.
