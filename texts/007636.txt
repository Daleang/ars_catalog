“Origaminization road-movie”—only on the move and the web.The Road Movie is a mobile installation system with Moblab (http://moblab.org), that was used for an art project and involved German and Japanese artists travelling through Japan by bus from October 18 to November 6, 2005.Webcams were installed in the bus, pictures of the view from the bus were taken and the resulting pictures were made available for downloading in Internet. These pictures were printed on a paper model of the bus which one could print and fold together to form one’s own Road-Movie. It brought a miniature version of the Moblab bus and something of the surrounding scenery during this journey into one’s own living room. This three dimensional recreation of the outside world in one’s own living room was a visualization of a foreign place, which was only possible through web technology.A really crazy trip, if you ask me!The System[On the bus]1.
