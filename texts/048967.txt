The Sports Time Machine, a device that lets you race against previous running records that are projected onto the wall, was premiered as part of the tenth anniversary celebration for the Yamaguchi Center for Arts and Media.Runners can attempt to break their own records, as well as racing against family members, friends and animals, with race records simultaneously saved as 3D data.It focuses on the act of running as not only a memory but also how it can remain as media, offering physical communication through sports, across the past, present and future.The venue was set up in a shopping street in cooperation with many Yamaguchi citizens and artists. The Media Undokai (Great Media Sports Fest) festival and workshop were held during the event, while citizens organized a conference, and the online features are continuing to expand.Looking ahead to Rio 2016 and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, it will develop as a project that connects with the future.Unlike memories, which can never be retrieved, the machine preserves and stores the experience as a medium and can share it with others in the future. With the machine, you experience physical communications where the past, present and future intersect through sports. The machine also continuously updates its function in the same way as traditional sports have from their very beginnings. While it is shared in local communities, the machine is simultaneously developed, maintained and revised by reflecting the way it is being played.When we exhibited in Yamaguchi, those playing a keen part in the milieu of the machine included IT engineers, families, people who worked nearby and kids who became very curious about it. What the machine actually did in Yamaguchi was to expand the concept of sports in a local community through IT, and as a result it blended technologies further into people’s everyday lives. People who came to the exhibition familiarized themselves with the idea of what future sports would be like in the IT era, and willingly participated in making it. Players of the game became the key players in the Yamaguchi City’s local community.After playing, the data were collected and uploaded to the cloud-based servers on which players can manage data on their personal pages.Such ubiquitously expanded functions are another important aspect of the machine. We believe that this openness is distinctively similar to what conventional sports have done in our societies, and this is one way in which future sports will contribute to communities.
