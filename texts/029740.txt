The "Entropy Machine" is an installation composed of a machine and 5 framed pictures depicting the human being as a body. The theme is the human and the technologies. Many significant aspects of the theme are encountered: genetic technology and information technology; ecology and interaction; media and observer; objectivity and subjectivity; complex systems and horticulture. Another important aspect is the effect of the observer on the observed artwork. Many basic structures of the "Entropy Machine" are changed by the observers. The "Entropy Machine" begins with a metal housing placed on the floor. The sides are closed with a reinforced plastic fabric. The box is only open at the top. A monitor is mounted at this top-opening. The monitor is surrounded by petridishes containing bacterial cultures. The whole box is an information greenhouse. Inside the greenhouse there is a computer working. The software randomly chooses an image from a library. The library consists of 40-50 different screen images (640 x 480 pixels). All images are directly related to the history of biology, time-based evolution or to the installation directly.Technical BackgroundHW: 80386/486/Pentium PCSW: Artist's Proprietary
