On a cold Saturday in New York City, the worldâ€™s largest train station came to a sudden halt. Over 200 Improv Everywhere agents froze in place at the exact same second for five minutes in the Main Concourse of Grand Central Station. Over 500,000 people rush through Grand Central every day, but today, things slowed down just a bit as commuters and tourists alike stopped to notice what was happening around them.
