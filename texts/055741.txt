Modern algal biotechnology is largely motivated by technocracy in response to food and energy crises. This biotechnological work seeks the utilization of microalgae not for technocratic ends but for a reconstruction of social practice at an ‘ecosophical’ intersection, as advocated by Félix Guattari (1989/2000) by weaving the three domains of the natural environment (photosynthesis of microalgae), social relations (digital printing), and mind (creative process of making).My laboratory-based collaboration with biochemists developed Algae Printing, which applies inkjet printing technology to seed algae on paper to grow and harness their air purification, health food, and bioelectricity applications in one compact creative system–a new concept of designing with living microbes.Algaerium Bioprinter is an installation contextualizing the Algae Printing technology and points towards bioindustry–an emerging development within the field of biodesign from ‘intellectual consumption’ to ‘utilitarian consumption’.
