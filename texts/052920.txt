Is the mind separated from the body? #FindingSomethingBondingSound addresses this ancient philosophical question by using state-of-the-art technology to hack the brain & the body and translate their activity into sounds and images related to the deepest feelings, emotions, and motivations.In #FindingSomethingBondingSound the brain can act as an audiovisual sampling system and the body movements (gestures) act as an effects modulator. The mind controls audio and video samples organized in a playlist according to neurofeedback paradigms. It uses states of mind, in 7 steps, from low arousal to high arousal and the body gestures control some effects.It uses several technologies including: Emotiv Epoc; R-IoT sensors (IRCAM); Audio Interfaces; Dj Mixers; Video Projectors, HoMy_EmoRAW (available at the Emotiv store); Max 7 (Cycling74); Live (Ableton), MnM/FTM filters (IRCAM). It also uses Video editors for non-linear editing and post-production.A Blue Vinyl / MusicBricks award incubation program project.
