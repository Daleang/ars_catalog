Five Pieces of Evidence is a five-screen video and sound installation that reflects on missing persons, urban myths, transition, mapping and global networks. Each of the five screens are themed on a narrative akin to a “whodunit”: the missing person, the assailant, the scene of the crime, the trail and the motive. A multi-layered set of scenes and references are evoked by missing persons notices, street maps, demographic statistics and images of pipelines, rail tracks and cityscapes. These clues and components, which can evoke endless possible narratives, are a reflection on the disappearances that are staged everyday in urban spaces.
