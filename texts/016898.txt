“Corpora in Si(gh)te” is an installation based on real-time processing of environmental data. A number of sensors are set up forming a mesh network throughout the target area in order to collect and distribute real-time environmental information such as temperature, brightness, loudness, humidity, wind direction and wind speed. This sensor network can be seen as the nervous system of the virtual structure. The data collected from these sources is processed by software and translated into autonomous nodes which we call “super eyes”. These “super eyes” are the seeds for the virtual architecture of “Corpora” representing a cellular, distributed network of nodes that react through real-time processing, growing and subsiding like an organism. Each “super eye” collects environmental data from the closest sensor and makes local decisions independently of a central architect. The “super eyes” inadvertently give rise to an architectural structure, both surrounding the exhibition building and neighborhoods. This “information architecture” of “super eyes” has its own spatial perception to make itself transform into various forms by relying on the “super eyes” spatial notation concept. The fluid character of this architecture occurs as a living form. Visitors can observe this process by augmented reality technology through cameras located at the target site.
