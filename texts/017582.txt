“Mobile Crash” is an interactive installation comprising four projections in a room with direct sound, creating an immersive audio and video environment. Through public interaction a series of “sentences” or rhythmic sequences are reproduced in increasing intensity, sound and action. Images show obsolescent devices and equipment being hammered to bits. It invites the public to share the actions as a kind of catharsis, which can be collective or individual.The environment is activated with the help of a customized infra-red-camera detection system, the interface was specially developed for the work and has proved to be very intuitive, robust and reliable. Once the viewer enters the space the system detects his/her direction and responds accordingly by playing a series of video sequences on the related screen.Inside the room, one just needs to point to one of the four screens to make it respond by triggering the videos. It produces instant dialogs between the screens and creates different rhythm possibilities with the audio as in a kind of live-video set.Interactions made by the visitors are a basic input for the system, triggering a series of audiovisual sequences. When modified by the interactor, the sequences produce rhythmic “dialogs” in a progressive sound and visual chain, escalating also in terms of intensity and power (with the technological devices—mainly mobile phones—being smashed by the hammers bigger and noisier). The sequences can reach up to 12 levels, according to the wishes of the interactors.Many people might wish to pick up the hammer and seek catharsis, a little revenge for having bought so many technological devices that will not be around in their lives for long.
