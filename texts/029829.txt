I call it "America's Finest" because it is the weapon that was used in Korea, Vietnam and the Gulf War. It is the gun that was aimed at America's Finest to protect them, and through which they dedicated their lives. The way this project works is that the user/participant aims the rifle at anything in the room. They not only see what the gun is pointed at in the specially equiped gun site, but also see themselves. There is a hidden camera that puts them into the "scope" along with random cycling images from history in which this particular weapon was used over the past wo years. Wars, weapons and media that have affected and afflicted our lives become one in this piece. If there is any message, it is that when you point your finger at someone else, three fingers are often pointed at you, and that the aggressor becomes the victim of his own violence. There are sounds, mixing and grabbing capabilities incorporated into the piece. It uses a Targa Board, custom software in C programmed by Paul Tompkins, a 3" active matrix color LCD monitor, a monochrome video camera and micro camera inside the gunsite. The gun can move 360 degrees, incorporates sensors and knows when it is picked up and the "trigger" is activated.Technical BackgroundHW: MacintoshSW: Paul Tompkins' Proprietary
