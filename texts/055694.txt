Text messaging technology in the early days was only available in the characters of the Latin alphabet. Arabs struggled to use the English keyboard in their daily texting communication. So they created their own system, which allowed them to write Arabic sentences using Latin letters. They added the numbers to the alphabets to represent phonetics that only existed in the Arabic script. For instance, “3” in 3arabizi represents the letter “t” (Ain). The system became part of youth pop culture in the MENA region, and it is now embedded in their everyday activities. Some call it “3arabizi” others call it “Franco­Arabic”.3arabizi is an Arabic chat language used for texting or writing in Arabic. The users don’t speak the language, they simply use their hands and fingers to communicate in it on different platforms. In the process the designer found connections between this system and how Muslims use their hands and fingers gestures as a method to keep track of their prayers in the Zikr remembrance of God ceremony. They use either the tip of their finger to count the finger joints 99 times or a string of beads Misbaha / Sibha, which is a unique counting system. A system was designed to use this counting system, to appropriate the English keyboard to reflect the MENA context, to question globalization and to show the significance of finding the right methods to adapt globalized systems to a specific culture.The project is still in its conceptual phase. The concept and the research phase developed in 2014 and I started to speak at different conferences and wrote an academic paper to develop the concept and work on the technical part in 2015. As I am not a developer or an engineer, it’s taking time to go through the whole process of production.
