Face to Facebook was a social experiment: stealing a million Facebook profiles, filtering them with face-recognition software and then posting them on a custom-built dating website, sorted by their facial expression characteristics. Our mission was to give all these virtual identities a new shared place to expose themselves freely, breaking Facebook’s constraints and boring social rules. So we established a new website (http://lovely-faces.com) doing them justice and granting them the possibility of soon being face to face with anybody attracted by their facial expression and related data. The action was set in five days of intense media coverage and thrilling, fast-paced events, which became a global mass-media hack performance. It has been defined as a performance since it happened after a long preparation as a unique live act over a short time span, and it involved the audience in a transformation through an evolving storyline. So far it has generated a few thousand reactions by people involved, triggered by the official website, the hundreds of tweets and more than 1000 press reactions (http://www.face-to-facebook.net/press-coverage.php). On a legal perspective, we received a cease-and-desist letter from Perkins Coie (the Facebook lawyers). The Facebook lawyers first asked us to take down the Lovely Faces dating website, which we did after a while, and now they are also pushing us to take down the Face to Facebook website, which hosts only the documentation about our artwork. We are fighting it on a legal basis, claiming that this an infringement of freedom of expression. The project makes up the third piece in a series that began with Google Will Eat Itself and Amazon Noir. The trilogy is called “Hacking Monopolism”. These works share a lot in terms of both methodologies and strategies.
