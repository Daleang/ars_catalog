The Osadok / Aftertaste installation presents an image of slowly falling potatoes. When the viewer reaches the ultimate state of meditation and is ready to turn around to leave, he or she is confronted with something unexpected: some potatoes start gazing at the person leaving with very natural-looking eyes. Shot with a rapid camera (100 f/s), the potato flow appears quite naturalistic, while slow-motion techniques, with their appetizingly juicy splashes and luxuriant, breathing textures, reference advertising. The potato may be considered here as an archetype of Russian everyday culture, yet in the museum space it is manifest as something alien: arising from the underground, at once alive and not alive, it is uncanny and alerting. The most affective moment, which gives the viewer a frisson of wonder, arises when the potatoes reveal their human eyes (again an archetype, in this case, of spiritual contact). How to interpret this gaze? Beyond a mere visual pun, it feels like a call for engagement, an elemental acceptance of that “other,” atomic, imaginary world hidden in the interstices of the ordinary. “Osadok” in Russian is not only “aftertaste,” but also “residue” and “precipitation.” One of the allusions the artists refer to is a mystical movement in Russian philosophy—Russian cosmism. But what is shown is not cosmism itself but only its “residue,” “aftertaste.”
