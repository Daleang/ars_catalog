Through the device of the "Inter Dis-communication Machine", two participants exchange their visual perspectives, which forces them to see things the other person's way. I am not you, and you are not me. Yet we are often confused and think that the other person thinks in a similar way. This real world actually only exists in the brain of any one person, so everyone sees a different world."Here, I am." In this case, "here" is the place where "my" eyes exist; it is the center of the world. Well then, what happens if I give my eyes to you ? And if I receive your eyes ? Then we will fuse to become one person. Furthermore, let's imagine "I am you and you are me." These are the ideas my work is based on. This machine is designed to be used by two people. The situation I have tried to create is that of a "double identity self" and "mutual identity". It may be compared to the phenomenon of seeing one's own doppelganger. Each machine is equipped with a HMD (Head Mounted Display) and a backpack. Each HMD has two monitors and a video camera. The HMD shows only the other person's view. The backpack is equipped with a battery (7.5 V), a TV tuner and a transmitter. A TV antenna is installed inside the wings. The machine uses radio waves to send the video image. The machine was designed to allow for the possibility of kissing and making love.
