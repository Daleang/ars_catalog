You need to go on a run-simulator to start up “a social mechanism.” On the one hand you feel like God, because the movement of the mechanisms depends on your steps, and on the other hand you are only one figure among all the others. The consciousness of visitors bisects—is the society absorbing each of us? Or do we ourselves form this enslaving mechanism? If you speak the “DaDa” manifesto into a microphone, the voice transmits a low-frequency impulse to the cellular structure, which begins to vibrate. As a result some figures fall off, liberated from the structure. One conveyor has a micro video camera, which shows a space inside a black box on a monitor—there is another reality in this box, the world of the artist.
