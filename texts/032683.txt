In the beginning was the idea of developing a 3D communication program that would be at once entertaining and useful. Why should it not be possible to enjoy taking a fantastic real-time walk through virtual reality worlds, meet friends there and communicate - but without cumbersome aids like data gloves and HMD? It was important to design an ergonomical program interface, which would allow anyone immediate intuitive access without having to labor through a manual first. This means that Roomancer is not intended to address a particular target group. Male or female, child, teenager, adult, computer professional or beginner -anyone can enjoy it. However, Roomancer was not developed just for the consumer area. As a "social interface" it is an ideal platform for communication, especially for use in Intranet/Internet. School students can set up their own networks with very little trouble and carry out projects together with partners.Roomancer is a new software product for the Windows 95/Windows NT environment.The display transforms your computer into a three-dimensional, virtual house-like environment... ... directories become rooms, entirely 30 withcomplete freedom of movement in every direction; ...files become 30 objects; ... and users become three-dimensional, excellentlyrendered, life-like virtual persons. Using an Internet/Intranet connection,you can visit other Roomancer users'"houses" or invite them into your "house". Then you can "chat", exchange files in the form of 3D objects, and much more. Since this software provides possibilities for a combination of global communication, practical data administration and creative interaction, you could call Roomancer a "FunTool".The name Roomancer comes from "room", "roomance" and "Neuromancer", the title of William Gibson's well-known science fiction classic.
