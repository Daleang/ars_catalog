AHORA is an interactive song, composed and installed in the Hypertemporal Surface. As temporal solids, its sounds exist potentially unfolded on the floor, waiting for someone to make them sound in response to the path they take.The Hypertemporal Surface is a software environment developed for musical composition in space. It makes it possible to “install sounds” in space. In other words, it lets us map time into space. As every moment of the original duration of sounds is anchored to a specific spatial coordinate, moving through space is literally moving through time. Anyone who walks inside this room evokes the potential times of the composition in a particular way; the song is rewritten with every new path. AHORA, as the compositional environment that hosts it, proposes a reflection about the relationship between time and space, about the idea of all times coexisting simultaneously in the same plane, and that it is the observer who updates them, bringing order and meaning.This work is based on a spatial composition principle. The distribution in space of four sound layers, each one belonging to a speaker, sets up the interaction possibilities for this musical piece. The position of the observer in the room controls a personal time cursor for all the sounds. If the viewer approaches the speaker, the volume rises and the instants that are heard depend on the angular position. If they stand still, time stops. Only by walking through the installation it is possible to know the immanent temporality of each sound. Only someone who walks through the Surface is capable of revealing, with their ears, the spatial morphology of these sounds created by Operadora, our musical project.
