The goal of the SLO-lnternet "Eye to Eye: Interactive Cybervision Environments for the Visually Challenged" project is to encourage people who are visually challenged to communicate visually over the Internet. The Internet will provide a live communication link between a SLO-Mac site at CAVS, MIT in Cambridge, MA, and a Mac-SLO site at the exhibition location. Each participating station will be outfitted with a video camera. In addition to the teleconferencing link using the SLO, visually challenged as well as fully sighted visitors to each location will be able to enjoy Poem Animations and Environments recently created for this project employing Silicon Graphics Imaging systems at MIT's Media Lab. These artworks may either be seen through the SLO over the Internet or via the SLO Mac interface at each location. Visitors will also be able to view live video images of people's retinas as they look at images, texts, faces and Poem Animations and Environments through the SLO.
