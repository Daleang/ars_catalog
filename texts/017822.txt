“Living Light” is a building envelope of the future, a permanent outdoor pavilion in a park in Seoul, and a piece of architecture that metamorphoses in response to air-quality data and public interest in the environment. People can text-message the building and it will text them back. The project combines issues of environmental quality and public awareness with a dynamic building-scale interface to our shared interests and collective concerns. The structure in a public park not only provides a canopy and a tactile enclosure, it also suggests that a building envelope itself can become a new kind of public space. The envelope of the pavilion is a giant map of the city with neighborhood boundaries re-drawn based on existing sensors of the Korean Ministry of Environment—each shape in this new map encloses the air closest to one of the sensors. The map illuminates to become an interactive, environmental layer of information.As people observe and interact, the envelope transforms in three ways. First, the neighborhoods light up if their air quality is better today than last year. Second, every hour, the map goes dark and the neighborhoods light up in order of the best current air quality to worst. Third, people can send a text message with a Zip code to the “Living Light” hotline, receive a reply with the Zip code’s real-time air quality, and trigger one of the panels to blink. More blinking means more public interest in the environment.The unusual structural frame of the pavilion was designed by re-drawing the city map to reflect existing sensor stations and by running a process of automated optimization. In this process, we generated and evaluated 25,000 possible designs based on two goals—best structural performance and least amount of material.
