Developed in collaboration with scientific laboratories in Japan, Germany, Russia and Belgium, Camera Lucida (“chamber of light” or “lucidity”) directly transforms sound waves into light emissions by employing a phenomenon known as sonoluminescence.Within a transparent chamber filled with a gas-infused liquid, multiple ultrasonic transducers generate a constantly modulating sonochemical environment. Ultrasound, propagating within a liquid, triggers the formation and implosion of micro-bubbles that reach temperatures as high as are found on the sun and emit light in the shape of sound waves. After adapting to the absolute darkness surrounding the installation, one gradually perceives the highly detailed configurations of glowing sound waves. The documentations of sonoluminescence presented on this DVD originate from an amalgam of recordings that took place at the Physics Institute of Goettingen University (Germany) and the Institute of Advanced Science and Technology (Japan) between 2003 and 2006. Just to be able to capture the phenomenon on video, it was necessary to achieve the brightest known sonoluminescence.
