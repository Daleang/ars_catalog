The Smog Free Project offers a journey through innovation, as an experience of a clean future and a local solution for parks and public spaces. It consists of the largest outdoor vacuum cleaner in the world, the Smog Free Tower, and Smog Free Jewellery, made from its captured smog.The 7-meter-high Smog Free Tower, opened last fall in Beijing, is the largest air purifier in the world which creates a local solution for citizens in parks to experience clean air for free. It cleans 30.000 m³ per hour via patented ozone-free ion technology and uses a small amount of green electricity. It efficiently captures and collects up to 75% of PM2.5 and PM10 airborne smog particles and releases clean air around the tower with a 360-degree coverage creating an almost circular zone of clean air in its surrounding.The Smog Free Jewellery is a tangible souvenir of the Smog Free Project. The Smog Free Ring and Smog Free Cufflinks are made from compressed smog particles collected from the Smog Free Tower. By sharing a Smog Free Ring, you donate 1000 m³ of clean air.The Smog Free Project is a part of Roosegaarde’s larger oeuvre Landscapes of the Future, which connects people, technology, and space to improve the quality of daily life in urban environments.
