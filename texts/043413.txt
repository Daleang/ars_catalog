Versus  is a sound installation consisting of two kinetic sculptures placed face to face. Each sculpture is made of 12 triangular panels, hinged and powered by six linear actuators, controlled by a specific program. At the center of each corolla, a loudspeaker and a microphone make it possible to play and record sounds.At regular intervals each sculpture produces a sound, simultaneously recorded and analyzed by the opposite sculpture, which then moves according to the frequencies of this sound.Like a feedback loop, it then plays back the recorded sound, with the errors and disturbances caused by the reverberating space and the visitors.By intervening in this conversation the viewers become actors, as they degrade the communication by their presence and the noises they produce. As the panels move back and forth at a pace determined by the environmental sound, they create a non-immediate interaction, where the imperfections of reproduction become creative elements.The original sound is continuously transformed and becomes something entirely new and unpredictable. The memory of past events is held for a moment, until it is reproduced, degraded, and then forgotten, replaced by the present.
