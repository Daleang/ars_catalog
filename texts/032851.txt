The concept and organisation of Backspace  is intrinsically linked to the ebb and flow of the Thames, a much abused and maligned source of inspiration and energy.Backspace is an open environment for exploration and expression on the Internet and the focal point for related events, audio, visual and otherwise, with particular bias toward the diverse talents of its members.Enquiring minds are encouraged to make contact and take up membership. Consider yourself invited. The Backspace site represents the activities and interests of its members, promoting access, discussion and development. Membership to Backspace comes in twelve flavours @ Â£20 per month! Subscribers gain: quality access to the web, an email account and an open invitation to drop in any time for as long as you like, come down to events, meet up with friends or just chill out by the riverside. Backspace now also features a growing collection of unique tools for enhanced use of the Internet: an event diary onto which anyone can schedule any weekly and special events that can then easily be searched and sorted to taste, Favespace where any user can recommend useful, extraordinary or simply beautiful sites, Relay is a personal log of the goings on in and around backspace and kept by different members each month.
