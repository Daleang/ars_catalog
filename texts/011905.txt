“levelHead” is a spatial memory game using a hand-held solid-plastic cube as its only interface. On-screen it appears that each side of the cube contains a little room, each of which is logically connected by doors.In one of these rooms is a character. By tilting the cube the player directs this character from room to room in an effort to find the exit. Some doors lead nowhere and will send the character back to the room they started in, a trick designed to challenge the player’s spatial memory. There are three cubes (levels) in total, each of which are connected by a single door. Players aim to move the character from room to room, cube to cube, in an attempt to find the final exit door from all three cubes. If this door is found, the character will appear to leave the cube, walk across the table surface and vanish. The game then begins again. Someone once said that “levelHead” may have something to do with a story by Borges.
