Un réseau translucide is a work that poses the question “how do we make performances for the future?” Developing a choreographic system in which the performers also generate the electricity, the work examines the relationship between the body and its environment, while opening up a dialog on sustainable development in artistic practice. It re-thinks habitual modes of stage production by creating the first autonomous performance that runs 100 percent on its own energy. Lang collaborated with Amanda Parkes from MIT Media Lab to invent “intelligent” costumes that could simultaneously harvest the dancers’ energy during the performance. Technological devices were created to convert the kinetic energy generated by the dancers’ movements into energy stored in small batteries sewn into their costumes. The energy from the batteries then powered the sound system, while a low-consumption high-luminosity LED lighting grid was hooked up to the dancers’ onstage bicycle.Developing a choreographic system in which the performers eat, expend, generate, respond, adapt and produce, the work examines the relationship between the body and its environment. Each performance is followed by a public discussion about sustainable development in artistic practice and the issue of “art leading technology” in order to innovate creatively.
